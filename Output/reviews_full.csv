5,Fast and Powerful!,"I've had it for about month and so I'm still amazed on how fast and powerful it is. Theres a button the top left of the keyboard that allows you to quickly change modes from quiet, balanced, performance and Turbo. I play on maxed out settings on turbo with ease. 

The Screen
This is the first laptop that i ever had to turn down the brightness because it is surprisingly BRIGHT! 80% is where I keep it. It's not 4k but still looks incredible. The refresh rate is smooth as butter when playing games or just browsing online.

Fan noise
I usually have it on balanced mode. When I'm watching movies, browsing online, YouTube or doing some work I don't hear the fan at all. But once I start playing a game this thing sounds like a jet about to take off. Definitely not for sneaking a game session at work or in a library. You will be heard lol. I bought a cooling pad that surprisingly can get louder than the laptop but it's to help make that laptop live a long life. I game with headphones so during gaming I don't anything but the game. I tried gaming without headphones and i did get used to the fan noise but headphones are the way to go.

The Sound
The sound can feel a bit deep but louder it sounds a bit piercing. The sound settings are a bit shallow. The sound did not wow me. I've heard Macbooks with better sound.

Battery
The battery does not last long at all. Even just browsing youtube it's going to last like 2.5hrs generously speaking. Unless you know you're going to use it for a short time somewhere then yeah that will work. But if you expect to game on t just battery then prepare for a short gaming session and lower performance on battery. It's the cost of having a high end GPU.

Games
Played newly released titles on ultra and it took it well with no hiccups. Cyberpunk, GTA V, Chronos, Dying light the beast ect. I play on turbo and with no apps playing in the background and I use a cooling pad fully maxed.

Overall
It's great if you buy when it's on sale. Battery sucks but if you're like me that always likes to have their laptop pluged in then yeah you'll be super happy with this. But if you're always on the go then this might be a bit of a struggle for you.

3,Beast performer for the price — average elsewhere,"Good with some compromises, amazing for up to intermediate gamers. This is my second one after I had to swap out my first one in less than 24 hours (thank you Best Buy Total otherwise I would have been stuck)—see Unfixable Cons below. I damaged the first one doing a simple unscrewing of the bottom plate.

Pros:
- Price – you can’t beat this price for the on-paper specs it has. You also get what you pay for, and there are weird limitations to the laptop’s power. More below.
- Screen is stunning. Crystal clear, super crisp, vibrant color, looks better than Retina in my opinion. For 240 Hz, which is plenty for me, this OLED screen is flawless, uncompromised and best in class.
- Size & aesthetics: it’s not stunningly lightweight, but not too heavy either. However, it is stupidly thin for a gaming laptop and very portable. Takes up slightly more room than the 16” Macbook Pro. This laptop is top notch looks with pretty lights and clean design, and it will turn heads. Some reviewers say the plastic on the back looks cheap. I simply disagree. This is a cool looking laptop.
- Numpad and keyboard – I love how this 16” laptop packs in a comfortable-to-use numpad. The key layout is really excellent, too. All keys are a full size, no awkward half keys. Full arrow keys, too.
- Performance – I’m running the GPU hungry game Black Myth: Wukong at well over 60 fps, even higher on my 1440p monitor. No tearing, no bottlenecking, super smooth, and gorgeous ray tracing. Though I describe many compromises below, Acer did NOT compromise on performance. It’s a beast performer on Turbo, and you will be able to run most games at ultra settings at HD resolutions at 1080p and 1440p. The 5070ti is capable of 4k performance, but I haven’t tested this.
- HDMI and Thunderbolt display support. I recommend not using a dock for video and using HDMI to USB-C direct to the laptop for best results.

Fixable cons / annoyances:
- Boot startup noise – Sounds like a running circular saw crashing through your window. If you’re setting up your laptop for the first time, you’re going to hear it a lot, and if your computer restarts in the middle of the night in another room, it will wake you. Turn it off immediately in BIOS.
- Bloatware – I recommend installing a clean copy of Windows, but be aware, you will need to backdoor the Intel RAID drivers during the installation. May be difficult for an intermediate Windows user. I opted to keep PredatorSense which is downloadable from Acer’s website, and actually has useful tools. Also, it comes with Windows 11 Home, so have a license ready if you require Pro.
- Heat – This thing gets REALLY hot. I recommend the Razer laptop cooling pad RC21-02300. Keeps it just a little warm during gaming sessions, cold to the touch during regular use.
- Hard drive replacement / expansion – don’t even think about upgrading the paltry 1 TB this comes with (I guess “you get what you pay for”). Your upgraded drive will have to be a secondary drive and will only be recognized by Windows (see cons for Linux note). I wanted to upgrade my main boot drive, and I had a painful time trying to backdoor the Intel drivers to make this work. 

Unfixable cons:
- Modifying – This is the HARDEST laptop I’ve had to modify yet. This laptop does not have easy access panels for upgrading the SSD or memory. Ten torx screws hold down the bottom plate, one of them stripped with no effort, and I warped the aluminum cover because that was the only option I had to remove the stripped screw. You’ll need a special screwdriver which I luckily had and a pry tool. The hard drive and the RAM are underneath thermal tape that is stuck on there pretty good, so use caution when removing. The nvme expansion slot exists, but it’s covered by the RAM’s thermal tape. Be very careful when taking apart, modifying and upgrading this laptop. Not novice friendly.
- No Linux – it is difficult to load Intel RAID drivers during a Windows Live USB installation. It is impossible with Linux. If you enjoy dual booting or maining Linux, you can’t do it with this laptop. Period. Alternative ways are running Linux on an external hard drive or running it through a virtual machine, but it is impossible to install and run on board. Comment if you know a way because I certainly don’t.
- FINGERPRINT MAGNET!! Looks like I eat nothing but fried chicken with how easy I get prints on the body.
- USB-C ports are only on the back of the unit. It’s awkward to reach around to find your USB-C port. I have a dock with front facing USB-C ports so I don’t mind. If I didn’t have that, this would be really annoying.
- Battery is butt. You might get an hour on a full charge and with eco settings. Realistically, you’ll get 45-ish minutes with average use. This is largely due to the inability to change refresh rates on the laptop screen, so your battery will heavily power the GPU. No way you’re doing any gaming without this thing plugged in to power. Wattage is limited to the GPU and CPU on battery, and thus games will run at abysmal framerates. I don’t know who out there is getting 3 hours of life, but that’s completely absurd. As this is my second unit, both units battery life was just horrible, so I doubt I have a defective battery.
- Speakers are the cheapest, tinniest laptop speakers I’ve ever heard since the 90s. All treble, zero bass, zero depth. You’ll need headphones or external speakers. The speakers do get nice and loud, but the louder it gets, the lousier the quality is. If quality onboard speakers are a must, pass this laptop up. You’ll hate these speakers.

Recommended based on the performance, aesthetics, and screen alone. It’s a great laptop if you’re mostly working and gaming at home. Not recommended if you need the complete experience to be quality. I won’t return it, but I can’t say I’m blown away by my experience. 3/5",No,ACER_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,acer,"Good with some compromises, amazing for up to intermediate gamers.

alternative ways are running linux on an external hard drive or running it through a virtual machine but it is impossible to install and run on board comment if you know a way because i certainly don t fingerprint magnet looks like i eat nothing but fried chicken with how easy i get prints on the body usb c ports are only on the back of the unit it s awkward to reach around to find your usb c port i have a dock with front facing usb c ports so i don t mind if i didn t have that this would be really annoying battery is butt you might get an hour on a full charge and with eco settings realistically you ll get 45 ish minutes with average use this is largely due to the inability to change refresh rates on the laptop screen so your battery will heavily power the gpu no way you re doing any gaming without this thing plugged in to power wattage is limited to the gpu and cpu on battery and thus games will run at abysmal framerates i don t know who out there is getting 3 hours of life but that s completely absurd as this is my second unit both units battery life was just horrible so i doubt i have a defective battery speakers are the cheapest tinniest laptop speakers i ve ever heard since the 90s all treble zero bass zero depth you ll need headphones or external speakers the speakers do get nice and loud but the louder it gets the lousier the quality is if quality onboard speakers are a must pass this laptop up you ll hate these speakers recommended based on the performance aesthetics and screen alone it s a great laptop if you re mostly working and gaming at home not recommended if you need the complete experience to be quality i won t return it but i can t say i m blown away by my experience 3

5,BEST BANG FOR BUCK LAPTOP DURONG 1ST HALF OF 2025,"Let me be clear: THIS THING SLAPS.

Tl;dr: if you plan to keep it plugged to a wall and don’t mind bad speakers, don’t look any further. There’s no better deal for an OLED panel, high refresh rate, i9, 5070Ti 12GBVRam and upgradable ram and storage.  

If you want a more detailed review see below.

Let’s get the cons out of the way:
-Speakers are bad, but a good headset/headphones can easily fix this.
-Battery is awful right now, for some reason you can’t switch the refresh rate to anything that’s not 240Hz, which causes your battery to drain supeeer fast: 1 hour AAA gaming - 3 hours light use. BUT, this is probably something Acer will fix down the line with an update (or at least I hope so). Although, if you’re like me and only use it while plugged to the wall, then it’s really not an issue.
-Fans can get pretty loud on TURBO mode lol, but quiet and balance are really nice.
-This might be exclusive to my unit: there’s a noticeable hiss/high pitched noise that appears for a couple minutes before the fans start picking up during a heavy usage session. Might be able to fix it by opening it but haven’t done so.

5,Fantastic Performance,"The performance on this system is impressive, given its price point. Every competitor is priced an additional $400-$600 more, given similar specs and display. The performance on many of the new releases has been excellent. I've been running Borderlands 4, getting 70-80fps on high using the 2k resolution with the monitor. Battlefield 6 has impressive performance, which I haven't benchmarked yet. Almost every other game released in the last 2 years seems to run at ultra settings, with ray tracing and shadows set to high, yet still maintaining very high frame rates. I recommend this PC. The one thing I would be mindful of is the heat, which will hamper performance if you can't find something like a book to prop it up or use one of those fan devices to help. As long as there is good airflow, this will run like a dream. It doesn't have a super-long battery life either.

3,Great Performance but Be Aware of Potential Issues,"I recently picked up this laptop and honestly it felt like a great deal for the price. It’s fast, handles games on high settings like a champ, and the RTX 5070 Ti is an absolute beast. I’ve had an overall great experience with performance whether it’s gaming or multitasking this thing handles it smoothly.

That said, there are a few drawbacks worth mentioning. The build quality could be better. The chassis is plastic and feels like it wouldn’t survive even a small drop without cracking. I get it though, at this price point some compromises are expected.

The biggest issue for me has been the touchpad and keyboard. The touchpad glitches out constantly. It becomes inaccurate or unresponsive to the point where it's almost unusable. It’s frustrating because everything else about the machine works so well. I didn’t get the warranty, big mistake on my part, so I’ll have to take it to a local shop and see if they can fix it.

Battery life could also be better. You’re most likely going to get around an hour and a half to two hours unplugged with just light usage. If you’re gaming, expect maybe 45 minutes to an hour tops, and performance is greatly reduced while running on battery power.

So would I recommend this laptop? Yes and no, It’s powerful, fast, and a solid choice for gaming. But be aware you might run into some hardware quirks. I’m not sure if my touchpad problem is a one-off or a common issue, but it’s worth keeping in mind.

2,"Specs Promise, Software Disappoints","I’ve used the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S daily for the past two weeks, and while it has some impressive features on paper, my experience has been underwhelming in key areas — especially when it comes to performance and software control.

⸻

  What I Liked
 • Sleek, modern design: This is hands down the best part. The Helios Neo 16S looks futuristic, premium, and thin for a gaming laptop. It feels like something from 2025 — in a good way.
 • Surprisingly good cooling: Thermals are actually well-managed. Under stress, the laptop stays cool without overheating. Acer did a great job with the cooling system here.

⸻

  What Let Me Down
 • Predator Sense is very limited: Compared to ASUS Armoury Crate or Lenovo Vantage, Acer’s Predator Sense feels outdated. There’s no GPU tuning, no manual overclocking, no advanced fan curve settings — nothing to help squeeze more performance out of the machine.
 • Locked-down GPU: I ran Steal Nomad benchmark multiple times and no matter what I tried (including external apps like MSI Afterburner), I couldn’t unlock better performance. It feels like the GPU (5070 Ti) is locked down by Acer’s firmware or software.
 • Performance issues:
 • I experienced small freezes and glitches, especially when closing games or connecting to my Samsung monitor — things like screen flickering and display kick-backs.
 • What really shocked me: my older Lenovo Legion with a 4060 performed better in RDR2. Smoother gameplay, higher FPS, and just a better experience overall — despite having lower specs on paper.

⸻

  Tech Updates I Tried

I fully updated the system: BIOS, GPU drivers, Windows, Predator Sense — everything. Still, the performance didn’t improve. It feels like the laptop’s full potential is being held back by Acer’s software limits, and that’s a shame given how good the hardware could be.

⸻

Conclusion

The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S looks great and stays cool, but it feels like a sports car with the engine capped. The limitations in software control, locked-down GPU performance, and weird system bugs really took away from the experience. It promises flagship-level specs, but in actual gaming and benchmarking, it underdelivers.

I wanted to love this laptop — and I still think the design and cooling are excellent — but the lack of tuning options and inconsistent performance are deal-breakers for me.",i ve used the acer predator helios neo 16s daily for the past two weeks and while it has some impressive features on paper my experience has been underwhelming in key areas especially when it comes to performance and software control what i liked sleek modern design this is hands down the best part the helios neo 16s looks futuristic premium and thin for a gaming laptop it feels like something from 2025 in a good way surprisingly good cooling thermals are actually well managed under stress the laptop stays cool without overheating acer did a great job with the cooling system here what let me down predator sense is very limited compared to asus armoury crate or lenovo vantage acer s predator sense feels outdated there s no gpu tuning no manual overclocking no advanced fan curve settings nothing to help squeeze more performance out of the machine locked down gpu i ran steal nomad benchmark multiple times and no matter what i tried including external apps like msi afterburner i couldn t unlock better performance it feels like the gpu 5070 ti is locked down by acer s firmware or software performance issues i experienced small freezes and glitches especially when closing games or connecting to my samsung monitor things like screen flickering and display kick backs what really shocked me my older lenovo legion with a 4060 performed better in rdr2 smoother gameplay higher fps and just a better experience overall despite having lower specs on paper tech updates i tried i fully updated the system bios gpu drivers windows predator sense everything still the performance didn t improve it feels like the laptop s full potential is being held back by acer s software limits and that s a shame given how good the hardware could be conclusion the acer predator helios neo 16s looks great and stays cool but it feels like a sports car with the engine capped the limitations in software control locked down gpu performance and weird system bugs really took away from the experience it promises flagship level specs but in actual gaming and benchmarking it underdelivers i wanted to love this laptop and i still think the design and cooling are excellent but the lack of tuning options and inconsistent performance are deal breakers for me,2,0.25,NEGATIVE,0.9904664754867554,-0.9904664754867554,0.0047667622566223145,0.0047667622566223145,0,0,0

4,"Great Performance, Great Screen, A Few Rough Edges","Display:
The display is honestly one of the first things that stands out. The OLED panel looks beautiful and the 240Hz refresh rate makes everything feel very responsive. Colors look rich, details pop, and the overall viewing experience is great whether you are gaming, watching videos, or just browsing.

CPU:
Even though the processor is limited a bit because the laptop is slim, it still performs really well. Getting around 3100 in single core and 20k in multicore on Geekbench 6.

GPU:
The 115w 5070 Ti performs way better than you would expect for its power limit. Games run smoothly on the highest settings. For example, getting around 120fps in Black Myth Wukong on ultra with ray tracing and DLSS is impressive. It can handle modern games without struggling.

Speakers:
The speakers are not great for the price. They sound weak and lack depth. Using a custom profile in FX Sound helps a lot, but out of the box they are underwhelming.

Battery:
Battery life is on the weaker side. The main issue is that the display stays locked at 240Hz even when running on battery. The panel and the drivers support variable refresh rate, but Acer has disabled it. Because of that the battery drains quickly and you will probably end up keeping the charger close most of the time.

Thermals:
With a laptop cooler, turbo mode, and fans at full speed, the temperatures stay pretty controlled. While gaming on ultra settings, the CPU usually sits around 79°C and sometimes spikes up to around 88°. The GPU stays around 77°C. For a slim gaming laptop these temperatures are quite reasonable.

Keyboard and Trackpad:
The keyboard has a comfortable feel. It is not too soft and not too clicky. Typing and gaming both feel good. The trackpad is average. It works fine but there is nothing special about it.

Software:
The Acer Predator software still needs improvement. It can bug out at times. Sometimes the fans get stuck at max speed and the only way to fix it is restarting the laptop. Other times it refuses to change power modes because it thinks the laptop is on battery even though the charger is plugged in. Restarting usually fixes these problems but it does get annoying. Acer definitely needs to polish the app.

My Take:
This laptop gives great value for the price. The performance is strong, the display looks amazing, and it handles games really well. If you can live with the weak speakers and the need to keep the charger around, it is a solid choice that delivers a lot for what you pay.",Yes,ACER_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,acer,"Display:

4,Almost perfect,"I was quite surprised by how good this laptop was. I usually think of bidget materials when it comes to acer laptops, but this one feels very premium. Im honestly amazes at the build quality. The laptoo is a bit wider than normal laptops so i doesnt fit in my bag but thats fine. The cooling is very good to. But to be safe i still got a laptop cooler. The laptoo being at 240hz always isnt a big deal for me, but thats something to keep in mind. It has a lot of ports and i appreciate the SD card slot being there still. The only thing that stopped this from being perfect is the software. I just wish they had something like armory crate and g helper. I would love to set wattage limits on the cpu and gpu and have custom profiles. The software for gaming mods is very barebones and you cant set your own fan curves. But these are not deal breakers. I was gonna purchase a laptop cooler regardless. For it being $1899 this is almost reasonably priced. Everything else is 600$ more. If this ever goes on sale for 1599 or 1699 get it. The software wont be perfect, but the build quality and hardware is incredible. 4.5 stars.",Yes,ACER_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,acer,"I was quite surprised by how good this laptop was.

5,Cheaper and more powerful than Zephyrus G16,"Very pleased with this ""thin and light"" version of the Neo 16. It's about 19mm thick (0.75""). About the same as a Macbook Pro or a Zephyrus G16, although it does have an extra 1"" sticking out the back behind the hinge. GPU performance is comparable to the Zephyrus, but CPU performance in the Neo 16S is about 50% higher, due to the 275HX CPU.

Screen is beautiful, keyboard is a pleasure to type on, with no discernable flex under normal typing. Build quality is excellent. The case does attract fingerprints.

The laptop has a 240Hz display, confirmed in Windows, even though both the inner box and the outer carton says  165Hz display.

Note that the GPU and CPU are slightly power limited by Acer due to the cooling limitations imposed by the slim chassis. So this laptop will be about 10% slower than, say, a Strix or other full-sized laptop. But that's the same tradeoff you'd make with a Zephyrus.

All tests were done in Turbo mode. Click on the links ahd hit Details to see average CPU and GPU temps, etc. 3dMark doesn't display the complete temp graphs from the runs online, but I have them if anyone has questions or wants me to post a graph from a particular test. Temperatures never got out of hand. CPU usually hovered around 100C during the most intense parts of the benchmarks and sometimes hit 103C, but that was rare. Intel allows the CPU to get as hot as 105C before it throttles. It hovers around 60C at idle. So that does eat into battery life. But battery life is comparable to other similarly powered laptops (with same CPU and GPU).

4,Game-Changer for Power & Portability,"I’ve been gaming and working on the Helios Neo 16S AI for a few weeks, and I’m thoroughly impressed. The 16” 240 Hz OLED display is spectacular—ultra-sharp visuals alongside smooth motion in every game and video. Paired with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and RTX 5070 Ti, this laptop tackles AAA titles at high settings effortlessly. DLSS 4 is a perfect match for this hardware, boosting performance without sacrificing quality.  

What really stands out is the build. At just under 19 mm thin, yet equipped with robust cooling (liquid metal + fifth‑gen AeroBlade 3D fans), it stays impressively cool even during intense gaming sessions. Ports are smartly positioned—Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, microSD, and USB-A/C are abundant, so no need for dongles. ()

Battery life? Great for light use—up to 6½ hours of video playback—but naturally, gaming drains it fast. Fans get audible under load, but it’s a trade-off for the raw power packed inside. ()

5,A True High-End Gaming Beast!,"The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI Gaming Laptop is an absolute powerhouse, and easily one of the best purchases I’ve made for both gaming and productivity. For the price, you’re getting top-tier hardware and cutting-edge features that truly rival much more expensive models.

The 32GB RAM ensures seamless multitasking — you can run multiple heavy applications without a hitch.

Display

The 16” OLED display at 240Hz is nothing short of stunning. The colors are vibrant, blacks are true black, and the high refresh rate makes everything from gaming to scrolling through content feel buttery smooth. It’s easily one of the best displays I’ve seen on a gaming laptop in this price range.

AI Features

The integrated AI enhancements really elevate the experience. From intelligent performance tuning to real-time background noise suppression, Acer’s AI integration makes a tangible difference in both gaming and productivity scenarios.

Cooling and Build

Thermals are handled very well, thanks to Acer's advanced cooling system. Even under load, the laptop remains relatively cool and quiet. The Obsidian Black chassis looks sleek, modern, and feels solidly built — it definitely has a premium feel.

Storage & Connectivity

With a 1TB SSD, you have plenty of ultra-fast storage for games and files. Load times are nearly instant. You also get a full suite of ports, including Thunderbolt and HDMI, which is perfect for multi-monitor setups or external accessories.

5,"Amazing display, quality, performance & thermal","Love that sleek and understated look that just look and feels premium.  It's thin and packs a HX processor, which was a surprise considering the thickness.  The thermals is amazing. (This is my second gaming notebook that I've bought this year for me and my kid, and it is far better than the one that cost over $1k more of the same GPU/CPU, and significantly thicker in March with pre-order).  

I'm also glad that I didn't see earlier reviews, otherwise, I would've bought at the full MSRP, which is  a great value at MSRP especially compare to its nearest comp.  Yes, it would be a steal at full MSRP.  My complaint is that my nearest Best Buy was out of stock earlier this year when I was ready to buy.  

The display is incredibly vivid, with ultra high color gamut, and 240Hz matches perfectly with the RTX5070Ti GPU.  

Even on the smaller things in life like Thunderbolt and Type C, I really appreciate that Acer enabled one of the Type C with direct dGPU connection.  My other gaming notebook from Best Buy had both connected to iGPU (hated it).  

I do play mostly on external displays, and appreciate the dGPU Type C and Power is on the back, and makes the cable management clean.
  

The built quality is great, but what really made me happy was that I got far far far more performance than other thin chassis that cost much more.  My only regret was that I wish Best Buy would've had this unit much earlier.  Could've saved me a few thousand dollars from my first RTX5070Ti that I bought before reviews existed (different brand).

4,"Powerful laptop, but needs some tweaking","I bought the Acer Predator Helios with Intel Ultra 9 and RTX 5070 Ti. Gaming performance is excellent, the screen is bright with good colors, and cooling handles long sessions well. However, I noticed that the CPU sometimes spikes up to 105°C for a few seconds when a workload starts, then it quickly drops back to normal and stays stable. On my previous ASUS laptop with Ryzen, I never had those temperature jumps.

Out of the box, the system also comes with a lot of preinstalled software, which slows down startup. After cleaning the bloatware and adjusting the startup apps, the laptop now runs fast and smooth — but the first impression wasn’t perfect.

Pros:

Strong CPU and GPU performance

Good display quality

Decent cooling once it ramps up

Solid build and design


Cons:

Short CPU temperature spikes up to 105°C

Too much preinstalled software

3,"Great Deal, Mid-Range Performance","Don’t get me wrong — this laptop is super powerful, and you don’t have to worry about whether it’ll run next-gen games. The price is insanely good (I got mine for $999).

That said, performance-wise, it’s only around the level of an RTX 5060 Ti — which isn’t bad, but considering that a desktop 5060 Ti costs way less, it’s a bit disappointing. You can unlock undervolting to squeeze out a bit more performance and improve heat management, but it takes some tweaking and isn’t straightforward for everyone.

Other downsides include the screen being locked at 240 Hz, the battery lasting around four hours or less depending on what you’re doing, and formatting? Forget it. The BIOS has VMD enabled — and the worst part? It’s hidden. You’ll need to go into the BIOS and press Ctrl + S to deactivate it.

Fan and heat management could definitely be better out of the box, but honestly, you get what you pay for. As for the speakers… I could probably buy better ones on SHEIN or AliExpress.

4,Great specs,"On paper the specs for the price is fantastic, beautiful OLED screen and 12gb 5070Ti along with a sufficient 32gb ram for under $2k is great. It's much slimmer and lighter than the non-S Neo16, both the laptop itself and the power brick. 

Downsides: refresh rate of the monitor is locked at 240 Hz so power consumption even doing web browsing or word processing type tasks is poor. Really wish they would give the option or automatically toggle to 60hz while on the igpu. Secondly, the power brick connections are bad. I went through 2 Helio Neos both with the same issue. At least the connector on the back of the Slim version clicks in more securely than the non-slim version. But both were touchy and would require unplug/replug at least half the time I turn on the laptop. I think with how great the specs are, Acer couldn't cut costs on things like the GPU or processor, so unquantifiable things like the charging cord is where they found ways to cut costs, unfortunately. Hopefully even with the annoyance of unplugging and replugging and making sure not to touch the power cord, it'll keep working as long as expected.

4,"Good Price to Performance , 115w MGP","Reviews seem to be limited at the time of writing. This laptop provides great price to performance. But there is a reason its 1899.99.. this laptop form facter is different. While thin, the cooling vents make it have a larger surface area than you may think. This makes accessories and backpack fitment more challenging. The build quality is nice though. The 275HX CPU in this form factor is a monster if you need cores, the H series chips in similar formfactors get annihilated. The 5070 ti is fantastic for games and data science.  The memory is upgradeable which is a huge plus for those that need 64 or 96Gb. The screen is beautiful but glossy and may not be bright enough for viewing in brighter environments. Two M.2 storage slots. Ports are adequate for this price. The cooler and fans actually arent that bad and do a pretty good job. The power brick is very manageable in size. I think its 230W? Keyboard is good, but the trackpad has too much texure in my opinion which causes to much friction. I used this laptop for a few days but some things i just couldn't get over. One, the speakers are horrendous. The two speakers only cover mids and you have to play with the equalizer to get them somewhat acceptable. If you dont always wear headphones, this might really disappoint you. Secondly, the software is straight up bad. I dont understand why these big companies can't make a basic interface like the community made gHelper for asus. Acer locks down the CPU so undervolting is currently impossible via software. The Nvidia 5070 ti is great, but it's capped at 115w max graphics power or MGP.. that 115 includes the dynamic boost. You are absolutely buying a power limited 5070 ti and it shows. Maybe a 10-15% difference than full power 5070 ti laptops. It does do great in my opnion for the form factor though.

OLED screen, which by the way, looks gorgeous. 16"" screen, 240hz display, 32 freaking gigs of ram and 1TB SSD. This was a winner. Opened it up at home, installer some games to test drive and all work flawlessly. The games were Warzone, Elden Ring, Red Dead Redemption, League of Legends, and WoW, all which were on MAX settings. It did get a bit hot at first but after running all the windows updates, it cooled off. It has all the ports you will need including an ethernet port for all you hardwired freaks like me. 3 USB connections, HDMI, and well pretty much everything youll need to rock and roll. Only time will tell of how long the quality of this product will last since Im not familiar with Acer as much (I have a Lenovo Legion desktop) but it seems like a well built product and definitely feels premium.

3,Did not live up to my expectations,"I have to say I have mixed reviews about this laptop. I sound system of this product is pretty bad in my opinion. The speakers it comes with are the worst have heard on any top tier gaming laptop I have used. It was all highs. There are no mid or low freqs. When you are playing games where there are multiple layers of sounds going on all at once, the speakers this system has can not handle it and it is just a horrendous, jumbled sounding mess. You cannot differentiate anything. Some sound effects could not even be heard as the low freq range they used could not be produced by the speakers. It sounded to me like they put in a set of tweeters and not speakers that could handle a wider range. Switching to headphones did not help. The issue was the exact opposite where the sound was primarily low s and the sound was muffled and muted. I tried three separate headphones I own and it was the same with all three of them. I had to download a third party program to tune the sound to something that I considered to be acceptable. Unfortunately, no amount of tuning was able to help with the laptops speakers. I spent several hours trying to get it to a point where it was natural sounding but it just sounded shrill, compressed, high-pitched. Overall, I really dislike the sound of the speakers. The speakers in my 10-year old laptop sound numerous times better. The speakers are more natural sounding cover a wider freq range and playing games, watching movies or playing music is quite a pleasant experience. This is not the case with the Asus. I could not enjoy using the Asus with the speakers. I had an ongoing issue with getting the system to release external hard drives and USB drives. I was being told that the drives were being used even though I had nothing open at them time. Some research indicated that this may be Armory Crate or MyAsus accessing the drives in the background. The speakers where really only audible if the system volume and the game volume were at max settings. When I put headphones on I had to go back into the game audio setting and turn all volume settings down to about 15-20% to keep my ears from being blasted. It was quite irritating to have to keep adjusting the volume to account for whether I was using the laptop speakers or headphones. Last thing about the sound. Adjusting the volume from 0-50 seemed pretty normal and linear. Once I got to 50 the volume did not really increase until I got to 90-100. This was for both system volume and adjusting volume with game setting. When launching a game the system would lock up for 5-10 seconds. I would get the windows ""ping"" sound and then the game would launch. The same thing would happen when I exited the game. The game would close and shortly after the system would freeze for 5-10 seconds. I would then hear the windows ""ping"" sound and would be to once again use the computer. The GPU temps stay pretty cool, staying between mid-50 to mid-60 in all the games I played at high settings. The CPU on the other hand always seemed to run higher than I would expect . Most the tie the CPU temp would get into stay in the upper 70s and low 80s. There were times where it got as high as 95. Even in a game like wow where on my 10-year old laptop with the setting set at 5/10 the CPU would stay usually in the 60s. Using the exact same setting on the Asus and capping frames at 60 to match the old laptops max frames, the Asus CPU temps would get in to 80s at times. Framerates were not bad for a laptop, Usually in Diablo 4 at max settings I got 150+, Black Desert online was 100+. WoW all depended on what I was doing. I a major citiy or in a raid I was anywhere from 60-90 fps. Flying in the open world I could get 200+ fps but I did get in the mid-20fps when doing something like an outdoor boss where there could be 30+ others participating at the same time and this is once again with WoW setting at 5/10 of the settings slider. I could have probably gotten higher results in some of these games if I messed around with DLSS and MFG settings. The monitor looked great but coming from my 10-year old laptop with a 1080, 60hz monitor this was to be expected. The keyboard was acceptable to me. I prefer a much more tactile feeling when I press and release a key. This keyboard has a much softer touch than I am used to and is probably something that someone who is into e-sports or competitive gaming would appreciate more. The build quality is what I expect from a gaming laptop. It was sturdy and solid in construction. I do like the easy access bottom. MUCH more convenient than having to remove 12+ screws to add an SSD or change update memory. If my only concern about a gaming laptop was how well the gaming performance on it was than I would have been happy with this laptop. It ran all the game I played on it quite smoothly (with the exception I mentioned above). But when paying a premium price I have to look at other issues like CPU and GPU temps, sound quality, any sort of quirks when using the laptop outside of gaming, etc. At this price I need something that I feel confident is gong to last me for several years and with the short time I have used this laptop and am not sure that I am going to get that.",No,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"I have to say I have mixed reviews about this laptop.

But when paying a premium price I have to look at other issues like CPU and GPU temps, sound quality, any sort of quirks when using the laptop outside of gaming, etc. At this price I need something that I feel confident is gong to last me for several years and with the short time I have used this laptop and am not sure that I am going to get that.",i have to say i have mixed reviews about this laptop i sound system of this product is pretty bad in my opinion the speakers it comes with are the worst have heard on any top tier gaming laptop i have used it was all highs there are no mid or low freqs when you are playing games where there are multiple layers of sounds going on all at once the speakers this system has can not handle it and it is just a horrendous jumbled sounding mess you cannot differentiate anything some sound effects could not even be heard as the low freq range they used could not be produced by the speakers it sounded to me like they put in a set of tweeters and not speakers that could handle a wider range switching to headphones did not help the issue was the exact opposite where the sound was primarily low s and the sound was muffled and muted i tried three separate headphones i own and it was the same with all three of them i had to download a third party program to tune the sound to something that i considered to be acceptable unfortunately no amount of tuning was able to help with the laptops speakers i spent several hours trying to get it to a point where it was natural sounding but it just sounded shrill compressed high pitched overall i really dislike the sound of the speakers the speakers in my 10 year old laptop sound numerous times better the speakers are more natural sounding cover a wider freq range and playing games watching movies or playing music is quite a pleasant experience this is not the case with the asus i could not enjoy using the asus with the speakers i had an ongoing issue with getting the system to release external hard drives and usb drives i was being told that the drives were being used even though i had nothing open at them time some research indicated that this may be armory crate or myasus accessing the drives in the background the speakers where really only audible if the system volume and the game volume were at max settings when i put headphones on i had to go back into the game audio setting and turn all volume settings down to about 15 20 to keep my ears from being blasted it was quite irritating to have to keep adjusting the volume to account for whether i was using the laptop speakers or headphones last thing about the sound adjusting the volume from 0 50 seemed pretty normal and linear once i got to 50 the volume did not really increase until i got to 90 100 this was for both system volume and adjusting volume with game setting when launching a game the system would lock up for 5 10 seconds i would get the windows ping sound and then the game would launch the same thing would happen when i exited the game the game would close and shortly after the system would freeze for 5 10 seconds i would then hear the windows ping sound and would be to once again use the computer the gpu temps stay pretty cool staying between mid 50 to mid 60 in all the games i played at high settings the cpu on the other hand always seemed to run higher than i would expect most the tie the cpu temp would get into stay in the upper 70s and low 80s there were times where it got as high as 95 even in a game like wow where on my 10 year old laptop with the setting set at 5 10 the cpu would stay usually in the 60s using the exact same setting on the asus and capping frames at 60 to match the old laptops max frames the asus cpu temps would get in to 80s at times framerates were not bad for a laptop usually in diablo 4 at max settings i got 150 black desert online was 100 wow all depended on what i was doing i a major citiy or in a raid i was anywhere from 60 90 fps flying in the open world i could get 200 fps but i did get in the mid 20fps when doing something like an outdoor boss where there could be 30 others participating at the same time and this is once again with wow setting at 5 10 of the settings slider i could have probably gotten higher results in some of these games if i messed around with dlss and mfg settings the monitor looked great but coming from my 10 year old laptop with a 1080 60hz monitor this was to be expected the keyboard was acceptable to me i prefer a much more tactile feeling when i press and release a key this keyboard has a much softer touch than i am used to and is probably something that someone who is into e sports or competitive gaming would appreciate more the build quality is what i expect from a gaming laptop it was sturdy and solid in construction i do like the easy access bottom much more convenient than having to remove 12 screws to add an ssd or change update memory if my only concern about a gaming laptop was how well the

4,Some nice upgrade from last year's model,"Good laptop with decent upgrades from last year's model, the toolless access bottom panel and the fact that I can add in new RAM or storage easily and in less than a minute is a huge plus for this laptop for repairability and upgradeability. I have not had any issues in the past week I've used this device, but for some reason my computer does not like having more than one storage unit installed so I have to deal with just one for now. Unfortunately, the main frustration I've had with the whole design change is that the Samsung pro SSDs with the heatsinks don't fit in this device, I've already tried both sides but the heatsink is too big. This wasn't an issue to last year's model, but I am also going to keep in mind if there's any other problems like I've had last year with the previous model like dead pixels or any other manufacturing defects. Overall, this is a nice upgrade from last year's model that had the 4090M and I already upgraded my RAM to 64GB. I would recommend sticking to the 2024 model if more vram or performance isn't needed since it seems like driver issues and unoptimized games are currently the real main problems with low framerates at the moment.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"Good laptop with decent upgrades from last year's model, the toolless access bottom panel and the fact that I can add in new RAM or storage easily and in less than a minute is a huge plus for this laptop for repairability and upgradeability.

4,Great with a caveat.,"Overall a great laptop. Great display, RTX 5080 w/16 GB VRAM. 32GB of system RAM. Not wild about the Intel 275HX processor, but it is almost the same performance wise as any AMD offerings.

Pros: Great 240Hz display. Looks as good as my 3440x1440 OLED display for my desktop PC. 
RTX 5080 graphics card will run anything I throw at it (except some older titles, which is a common issue for Nvidia RTX chipsets).
Intel 275HX processor runs good.
Open m.2 slot
Bottom removes without tools. M.2 tool less as well. 
Added a 4TB gen 3 m.2 drive in second slot. Works perfectly. This PCIe 3x4 drive came out of older laptop. 

Cons: Intel 275HX tends to run a little hot. Needs a very cooling pad to keep the temps low. Keeping the temps low help keep from thermal throttling.
Uses a lot of power for a laptop. Power brick is 380 watts. 
IMHO 2TB storage is a bit low for most users now. Especially since a lot of games want 100 GB or more of storage. 
Processor is supposed to be capable of DDR5 6400, but ships with 5600.

Major con (this is the caveat I mentioned in title). Automatically updates BIOS when available. The problem with the update is that the system locks up at ROG boot screen upon rebooting. Eventually it will go on past the logo screen. However it takes some patience since it usually requires shutting power off and leaving the system off for an hour or so. I had this happen twice so far. Both times took it to the Geek Squad desk. First time the tech did something that got it working. The second time it just finally booted to windows on its own. I was literally watching the technician and the screen to see what was happening. She didn’t touch anything except the power on button. 

I’m not unhappy about the purchase, but I wish ASUS would fix their UEFI bios updates. I replaced a 4+ year old Gigabyte Aorus with this unit. The old unit is on left with this G18 on the right.

4,A really solid performer but with some drawbacks,"I started my journey with this laptop a little week ago. Here are my overall thoughts on this “desktop replacement” 
   The unboxing is quite the experience. This “laptop” is a massive beast and you go through a mix of emotions. Heavy and thick and the charging brick reminds you of exactly that, a brick!  You instantly realize this is a unit you won’t be taking to Starbucks for a long writing session but you know this unit is about to blow you socks off when it comes to performance. 
    It’s plastic but feels incredibly solid. Screen easily opens up and you are greeted with its ginormous Keybed and trackpad with not much flair other than some Rog branding that is tasteful. Once you fire it up you are greeted with a lovely intro and the RGB light show roars to life. The underglow would make bin diesel proud. Setup is the standard windows experience and a few hours of updates and restarts are a must before you can dive in. 
   Once you go through all the updates it’s finally time to see what this bad boy can do. I’m a tinkerer and I am a sucker for tuning and running benchmarks. That cinebench 23 score is a sight to see. My 275hx after tuning is scoring 37633 which is just insane for a “laptop”. Gpu benchmarks left my jaw dropped. I watched 3 1/2 year old precious desktop  build get destroyed over and over. 
  This guy is not only shaped like a tank, but it’s an absolute beast under the hood. Gaming is an absolute dream hands down. This laptop PERFORMS! 
    I instantly knew it was time to upgrade my unit with a fresh 4tb nvme. Opening the back of the laptop was insanely easy. Just slide a simply lever and the backside frees right up greeting you with 2 nvme bays (one is occupied) and upgradable ram slots. The nvme I installed took a bit of time because the built in plastic clip that turns to hold the drive down (no screw needed) and I was honestly scared I was going to snap it because it took a lot of force to turn by hand. After working it back and forth it feels like it probably should. Snug and holds the drive perfectly. Call me crazy but a simple tiny screw holding the drive down would have been easier at least on my unit.
   Keyboard and trackpad are excellent. This is no MacBook in build quality, but everything functions as it should and the trackpad is usable enough that I wasn’t instantly searching for my external mouse while navigating windows. 
   Now on to the mid part of this laptop. Its screen has some light bleed in gray scenes but thankfully it’s not viewable in all content. Its colors are vibrant and really solid for an IPS panel. Just know this screen is definitely not going to win any awards. It’s perfect for gaming and accurate enough for content creation, but watching movies is going to be a letdown compared to what most of us have in our living rooms. This is a far cry from an OLED or mini LED but it is “good enough” 
    The speakers are also not going to win any awards. They state it’s a 4 speaker system but the tweeters under the screen (small slits in the laptop hinge) on the front of the laptop don’t do much. You mainly hear the downward firing speakers and they are pretty midrange focused. Some dialing in via the Dolby access app solved some of these issues as I found the 500k and 2-4k ranges were boosted far too much and it caused ear fatigue with pretty much any content. Don’t be expecting much bass below 150hz. Everything is loud enough to hear over the fans when they ramp up, but headphones would definitely be ideal. 
    Battery life is pretty much a joke but I guess it’s usable in a pinch. 3-4 hours doing light work with the GPU disabled. Maybe an hour in a light game with restricted settings.
     Short summary- Yes you are paying for the internals and they perform at a high level! Just be aware that there is some drawbacks to a device like this. Yes, it’s portable in theory, however I don’t see my unit being taken anywhere other than to a buddy’s house for a rare gaming session. This isn’t really travel friendly and the battery life isn’t great and that charging brick needs to be tethered. The screen and speakers and plastic build all work fine and are usable, but you realize these 3 areas are where the cutbacks happened. All in all if you plan to buy this unit, know what you are getting. This isn’t really a laptop. It’s definitely in the desktop replacement class and if you go into this unit understanding that then you will be happy. It’s a beast of a gaming pc and the specs and performance are enough to make your desktop collect dust. 

Final thoughts- wait for a sale if you can. Yes you get a lot for the msrp, but there are enough drawbacks that I don’t feel it’s worth it at full price when the market is saturated with several respectable competitors.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"I started my journey with this laptop a little week ago. Here are my overall thoughts on this “desktop replacement” 
   The unboxing is quite the experience. This “laptop” is a massive beast and you go through a mix of emotions. Heavy and thick and the charging brick reminds you of exactly that, a brick!  You instantly realize this is a unit you won’t be taking to Starbucks for a long writing session but you know this unit is about to blow you socks off when it comes to performance. 
    It’s plastic but feels incredibly solid. Screen easily opens up and you are greeted with its ginormous Keybed and trackpad with not much flair other than some Rog branding that is tasteful. Once you fire it up you are greeted with a lovely intro and the RGB light show roars to life. The underglow would make bin diesel proud. Setup is the standard windows experience and a few hours of updates and restarts are a must before you can dive in. 
   Once you go through all the updates it’s finally time to see what this bad boy can do. I’m a tinkerer and I am a sucker for tuning and running benchmarks. That cinebench 23 score is a sight to see. My 275hx after tuning is scoring 37633 which is just insane for a “laptop”. Gpu benchmarks left my jaw dropped. I watched 3 1/2 year old precious desktop  build get destroyed over and over. 
  This guy is not only shaped like a tank, but it’s an absolute beast under the hood. Gaming is an absolute dream hands down. This laptop PERFORMS! 
    I instantly knew it was time to upgrade my unit with a fresh 4tb nvme. Opening the back of the laptop was insanely easy. Just slide a simply lever and the backside frees right up greeting you with 2 nvme bays (one is occupied) and upgradable ram slots. The nvme I installed took a bit of time because the built in plastic clip that turns to hold the drive down (no screw needed) and I was honestly scared I was going to snap it because it took a lot of force to turn by hand. After working it back and forth it feels like it probably should. Snug and holds the drive perfectly. Call me crazy but a simple tiny screw holding the drive down would have been easier at least on my unit.

5,Great Workstation for Design & Gaming,"Overall, from start to finish the set up and use has been incredible.

I’ve been using this laptop for all my work programs and it handles everything without a hitch. Performance is smooth and reliable. Battery life is decent, but I wouldn’t recommend running heavy tasks unless you’re plugged in and using the main GPU.

I tested it with RUST on a 600-player server, max settings, and it stayed at around 100 FPS. Since RUST is a CPU-heavy game, that’s pretty impressive, though your results may vary depending on the game or workload.

The screen is sharp and clean, with no backlight bleed that I’ve noticed. The top metal surface feels really smooth and comfortable for typing. The touchpad is pretty sensitive, but I use an external mouse so it’s not an issue for me.

This is a strong choice for anyone who needs a reliable work laptop that can also handle gaming. I’m confident it’ll stay solid for years to come.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"Overall, from start to finish the set up and use has been incredible.

3,Good but had defective unit,"I purchased this to replace my ""Alienware - Area 51M R2 Laptop - FHD- 300Hz- Intel Core i7 - NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER, 32GB RAM"" spec gaming laptop.  Although it has a i7-10700K desktp CPU in it, it requires two power supplies and the main 360Watt is massive.  So I was happy to see not only did this one have one single power supply, but it was smaller than the main power supply of my other laptop.  I saw someone say they thought this power supply was massive but compared to the previous two Alienware laptops, this is a great size for the amount of power it provides.

Setting this up for the first time out of box took about 45 minutes or so to get all the updates.  There were mutiple bios updates from Asus as well.  However those were painless as it was pretty much automatic.  Other systems I'd have to put it on a USB to install it but the bios updates on this machine were as easy as a windows update.

I did a lot of testing with Forza Motorsport, Forza Horizon 5, Ratchet and Clank, and many others.  The LCD panel has amazing color accuracy.  Sure, you don't get the dark blacks like an OLED or mini-LCD, but it is an excellent screen none-the-less.  The ray-tracing worked well.  As a casual gamer, I still haven't found the need for it but is definitly cool to see when you can crank it up and still have smooth performance.

However, that is where the first issue came in.  Although you can run high leel of ray tracing settings, I would get glitches in many games.  I would say maybe once every 5 to 10 mintues my character in Ratchet and Clank for example would turn into a series of vertical lines briefly then return to normal.  In Forza the exact same effect would happen on some trees in the distance.  Not bad enough to return, but definitly not something you'd expect for the cost.  I can have lower settings on the 2070 super notebook without those issues.

The performance was great, the screen was great, and aside from a few glitches, I was happy.  But then I tried to test VR games with a wired link using the thunderbolt ports with the Meta Quest 3.  That's when I found any device I connect would only work in USB 2.0 compatiabilty mode.  Therefore, it was too slow to play any PC VR games.  I tried hooking up my thunderbolt USB-C NAS drive to it, and same thing happened; I could only get about 370mb/sec.  When I went into the BIOS, there is a USB test feature.  With the Quest 3 connected, it showed it supported USB 3.0 but was operating on USB 2.0.  No matter what settings I adjusted in Windows for power, and any USB settings I could find, nothing I connected would operate higher than USB 2.0.  When I went to support, they wanted me to send it in for an RMA.  That shouldn't happen after less than 24 hours with the system. :)  That is the primary reason I returned it.  

The other thing I didn't like, but not a resason to return it, was the RGB keyboard.  There is not really a plain white solution.  It has a blue hue to it which doesn't show up in the photo.  The WASD area and space bar I think they tried to make unique from the other keys but to me just looks odd.  My alienware laptop has a per key RGB and has a clean white if you so choose.  I mostly had the RGB off except for the off-white keyboard to see in the dark but even that, if you reboot or do anything, it lights up like a christmas tree with the rainbow effect which would be nice to keep off if you have them off in the settings all the time.

Overall for the price, I think it's good.  It's about $600 more than the last Alienware laptop I got when it was new.  You can order a custom build to this on  Dell and is still a few hundred dollars more so I think if you're ok with the keyboard RGB limitations and don't have a defective unit, this laptop has a lot of potential.

Build / Screen:
While the build is not terrible by any means, it’s mostly plastic with exception of the lid/back of the display). I personally like the way it looks overall, especially that the back looks a bit more like the Asus ROG Zephyrus line of laptops. It has a really cool LED strip all around the bottom, which looks really nice in a dark room, and it can be customized so you can shut it all off. The hinges on the screen are for me the most critical in the build quality and thankfully this seems to be very sturdy. While I am not totally in love with the plastic parts on the laptop, at least it doesn’t pick up fingerprints on it as much as you would think. I don’t notice them much where I touch the body. This is an 18” screen, but keep in mind this is only an 8-bit panel. My unit didn’t have much backlight bleed. It had some, however it was very minimal, as is the case with virtually all LED IPS screens that are not OLED, and it does get pretty bright for me, but I wish the contrast were a lot more given the cost of this machine. Granted, those are also 16” screens and not 18”. I have this laptop generally set up with a large OLED screen for playing games, and it is great on that screen, and you can still push the resolution to 2.5k and not full 4K to save on performance. I do really wish it had at least a micro-LED screen or at least a 10-bit panel for better color display handling for times when I do want to play directly on the laptop display itself. What the display does do very well is provide a great sweet spot for a laptop screen of this size, 2560 x 1600, and a 240hz screen (which comes in very handy as this video card can do “Frame Generation” - more on that later.


Keyboard and trackpad
The keyboard is pretty good, it feels pretty nice to type on, very little flex on the front. However I personally do not care so much for the transparent “ghost” keys on the ‘QWER ASDF’ and space bar. It is very subjective I know, but I truly would have preferred the same key caps like the rest of the keyboard. You also get a full sized keyboard layout, with a num pad! This is great for me, as I use 3D software where this is critical for me and my workflow, with so many shortcuts for different software I use tied to a NUM pad specifically. The RGB lighting can all be controlled inside the Armory Crate software. Armory Crate will also let you customize the light bar that runs all along the bottom of the laptop too, including turning it all off. I really like the trackpad, I don’t think it is glass, but it is pretty big and responsive to left and right clicks.

Upgrading - this is crazy how easy it is.
A new introduction to the world of laptops is how easy it is to access the internals. Just shut the laptop off, close the screen lid and flip it over. You need ZERO tools! There is a latch, and you can then just take the bottom cover off, where you have access to the SSD slots, there are two, and one is already populated. The other will take a standard 2280 SSD. You also have access to the 2 RAM slots where you can pull the two sticks out and upgrade to more than the included 32GB of RAM size. While most other gaming laptops aren’t that hard to upgrade depending on the model, there is always a bit of a risk with disconnecting the battery from the motherboard, and things that can be a little tricky for some people to do. The latch system seems to actually block the battery power once it is removed so you can’t short anything out on the system (the reason you need to disconnect the battery when upgrading other laptops).

Processor - plenty fast - even for content creation
The processor is really great on this machine, it is an Intel Ultra 9 275HX, and chewed through a whole bunch of apps I threw at it. Luckily, what does seem to be a whole lot better with this G18 laptop is power efficiency compared to last generation intel chips. It seems to run faster while draining less power, which is good, as it means you can divert more of that power to the GPU. It is definitely faster than my previous laptop, however it is not leaps and bounds faster.

GPU - RTX 5080 laptop GPU - this laptop can run this GPU up to 175 watts the max amount NVIDIA will let manufacturers go in a laptop.
This is the meat and potatoes for most games, and yes, it runs most games I have tried great. Nvidia finally got most of their driver issues with all the new RTX 5080 series in the last week and half of me writing this, and I had no issues after that last driver update so far. The great thing with having a “larger” sized laptop, is that Asus is able to throw more wattage to both the GPU/CPU because there is more room for cooling in laptops of this size. Of course that comes at the cost of having something that isn’t quite as portable, but I think if you are buying an 18 inch laptop, you mostly are going to have it in one place most of the time. Now here is the thing with this laptop's GPU. While it is really good for a full powered laptop GPU @ 175watts, it isn’t leaps and bounds over my RTX 4080 laptop that also ran at full wattage in 2023. At least that is, not until you turn on some of the new features the RTX 5080 can do that the 4080 could not, and that is frame generation! Yes, it works! On Cyberpunk 2077 with their latest patch and the newest NVIDIA drivers, it definitely looks great, but cranking it up too far, and it introduces a bit too much latency for me. I was a bit on the fence about frame generation, but it really does help, as long as you don’t over-crank settings. You want to at least get your game running at 40-50fps so it has a decent frame rate to begin with so that the DLSS and Frame Generation can have a good source to work from. And the screen is G-Sync compatible, so if your frame rates in games vary up and down you will not get screen tearing, which is a great thing to have on the display.

Speakers
They sound pretty good for a laptop, but if you are gaming, you are going to want to use headphones, as the fans get loud under heavy load. In fact, I am glad those fans kick in that loud, it keeps your system running cool. That is the price you kind of have to pay for having a system with this much wattage and performance, it needs to be cooled off.

Portability
Look, this is a big and fairly heavy laptop. It is 18” and it is pretty heavy, especially if you have to carry the charger with you. However if you don’t need it to carry around everyday, and just need to move it around your home you will be good. I would even be ok with taking it here and there on occasion, just not daily. This is not the kind of laptop you want to have on your back everyday.

Overall
This is a great spec laptop if you need this large of a screen. My only issue with it is that for the asking price I wish it had a better quality display with at least a 10 bit display panel. Luckily it is 240hz and G-Sync compatible. I am only not giving it a full five star rating because of the display. Otherwise, this is a nearly perfect machine, especially if you are coming from any gaming laptop older than 2 years ago, the RTX 30XX based NVIDIA series GPUs, this will be a MAJOR upgrade.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"Great specs, and very good performance.

5,The Gozilla of gaming laptops,"ASUS and their Republic of Gamers (ROG) line of gaming PCs continues a great run in 2025.  This year I acquired the new Strix G18 gaming laptop.  Physically this is like a boat anchor, there is no effort to make this lightweight or portable.  Sure, if you are going to a meetup or a friend’s house then you can throw this in a well-protected backpack and take it with you.  Don’t forget the power supply, yea this thing has a battery – but you don’t want to rely on it.
 
Ergonomically the Strix G18 is substantial, weighing in at over 7lbs, all in a plastic case.  Although the case is well designed it almost screams for a more premium chassis to match the class of components in this system.  A supple keyboard with keypad, lighting the gaming keys and spacebar with a large trackpad.  There are dedicated keys for volume up, volume down, mute, power and a button to invoke the Armoury Crate software.  Armoury Crate is ASUS’ software which provides you with deep insight and tuning abilities primarily with a CPU and GPU focus.  Several preset modes are provided to keep all the performance related black magic behind the scenes.  Performance profiles include Windows, Silent, Performance, Turbo (AC Powered only) and a Manual preset.  Be aware of some the enhanced performance modes overclock the CPU/GPU and can really raise the temperature testing the limits of cooling on this system, the fans will definitely scroll up with high GPU and CPU utilization. In any case the 18 inch 2.5k IPS ‘Non’ touch IPS screen with a 16:10 aspect radio.  The display is bright with some bleed through in dark scenes, but this screen will light up the room if necessary.  The NVIDIA RTX 5080 GPU w/16GB of GDDR7 memory is the star of the show here, this model is paired with an Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 CPU, this is a pair made in heaven as this notebook performs.  The CPU cruises normally at about 2.7GHz it will amp up to 5.1GHz, blazing those 8 performance centered cores with 16 efficient cores. Of course, this calls for some advanced temperature cooling and ASUS uses Tri fan technology matched with something branded as “Conductonaut Extreme” (which sounds like a metal band).

I will avoid diving too deeply into gaming performance, I only play a few games, but those I do play including ACE Combat 7 and the more demanding Starfield, looked silky smooth with no dropped frames or glitches.  I maxed out at about 80fps on Starfield @ 4k.  In general this system performed flawlessly with high frame rate games.  Although the Nvidia 5080 GPU really shines performance wise, I had some issues with the latest Nvidia Studio drivers and had to revert back to a version which was on the ASUS support site.  This is the second instance of installing drivers from the Nvidia app caused stability issues (in this case external monitors not waking from sleep mode or Windows Hello responding). So as always is the case with video drivers, they evolve and improve, so looking forward to a newer stable version of those drivers so I can move to a normal update channel from Nvidia. 
Ports and Expandability: on the sides of this notebook are two Thunderbolt 5 ports with support for DisplayPort, power delivery and G-SYNC. An HDMI 2.1 port, Three 3.2 Gen 2 USB-A ports, a 2.5gbps ethernet port on this system and a headphone jack.  Wi-Fi 7 compatibility when paired with a Wi-Fi 7 router, especially one with a 6GHz radio reach almost gigabit speeds.  There is no SD or Mini SD card reader.

Overall, system performance is Steller and this is the fastest Windows laptop I have ever used.  Easily handling demanding and high frame rate games to sync up with the 240hz IPS panel.  Performs well for gaming or content creation, the appearance is unique, components are high spec and perform well.  

Another use case for this class performance notebook (or portable workstation) is being a key component in creating content – including moderately advanced video editing.  Performance in Davinci Resolve Studio was vastly improved over my ASUS Zephyrus gaming notebook.  This may be a high-performance laptop targeting gamers, however since video editing stresses some of the same computing components (CPU and GPU) as gaming, this also makes for a premium, high end video editing rig.  Edit screens and functions within Davinci Resolve worked flawlessly, rendering blazingly fast.  No need to reduce a 4k timeline to HD for editing, the Strix handles the workload with ease. No struggles with live previews, timeline refreshes, special effects, fusion components or other GPU intensive activities.  

Pros:
- Large form factor
- Performance oriented, blazing quick CPU and GPU
- Ports: two Thunderbolt 5 ports, HDMI 2.1 port, Three 3.2 Gen 2 USB-A ports, a 2.5gbps ethernet port on this system and a headphone jack.  
- Bright 18 inch 16:10 2.5k IPS non touch screen – high refresh rate
- IR Camera built in, provides you the ability to leverage facial recognition for biometric based logins with Windows Hello.
- Easy remove back panel for access to Memory and SSD slots.

Cons:
- Given this is a gaming laptop, a larger capacity SSD and more RAM is needed right out of the box for even better performance.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"ASUS and their Republic of Gamers (ROG) line of gaming PCs continues a great run in 2025.

Sure, if you are going to a meetup or a friend’s house then you can throw this in a well-protected backpack and take it with you.  Don’t forget the power supply, yea this thing has a battery – but you don’t want to rely on it.
 
Ergonomically the Strix G18 is substantial, weighing in at over 7lbs, all in a plastic case.  Although the case is well designed it almost screams for a more premium chassis to match the class of components in this system.  A supple keyboard with keypad, lighting the gaming keys and spacebar with a large trackpad.  There are dedicated keys for volume up, volume down, mute, power and a button to invoke the Armoury Crate software.  Armoury Crate is ASUS’ software which provides you with deep insight and tuning abilities primarily with a CPU and GPU focus.  Several preset modes are provided to keep all the performance related black magic behind the scenes.  Performance profiles include Windows, Silent, Performance, Turbo (AC Powered only) and a Manual preset.  Be aware of some the enhanced performance modes overclock the CPU/GPU and can really raise the temperature testing the limits of cooling on this system, the fans will definitely scroll up with high GPU and CPU utilization. In any case the 18 inch 2.5k IPS ‘Non’ touch IPS screen with a 16:10 aspect radio.  The display is bright with some bleed through in dark scenes, but this screen will light up the room if necessary.  The NVIDIA RTX 5080 GPU w/16GB of GDDR7 memory is the star of the show here, this model is paired with an Intel Core Ultra 9 Series 2 CPU, this is a pair made in heaven as this notebook performs.  The CPU cruises normally at about 2.7GHz it will amp up to 5.1GHz, blazing those 8 performance centered cores with 16 efficient cores. Of course, this calls for some advanced temperature cooling and ASUS uses Tri fan technology matched with something branded as “Conductonaut Extreme” (which sounds like a metal band).

I will avoid diving too deeply into gaming performance, I only play a few games, but those I do play including ACE Combat 7 and the more demanding Starfield, looked silky smooth with no dropped frames or glitches.  I maxed out at about 80fps on Starfield @ 4k.  In general this system performed flawlessly with high frame rate games.  Although the Nvidia 5080 GPU really shines performance wise, I had some issues with the latest Nvidia Studio drivers and had to revert back to a version which was on the ASUS support site.  This is the second instance of installing drivers from the Nvidia app caused stability issues (in this case external monitors not waking from sleep mode or Windows Hello responding). So as always is the case with video drivers, they evolve and improve, so looking forward to a newer stable version of those drivers so I can move to a normal update channel from Nvidia. 
Ports and Expandability: on the sides of this notebook are two Thunderbolt 5 ports with support for DisplayPort, power delivery and G-SYNC. An HDMI 2.1 port, Three 3.2 Gen 2 USB-A ports, a 2.5gbps ethernet port on this system and a headphone jack.  Wi-Fi 7 compatibility when paired with a Wi-Fi 7 router, especially one with a 6GHz radio reach almost gigabit speeds.  There is no SD or Mini SD card reader.

Overall, system performance is Steller and this is the fastest Windows laptop I have ever used.  Easily handling demanding and high frame rate games to sync up with the 240hz IPS panel.  Performs well for gaming or content creation, the appearance is unique, components are high spec and perform well.  

Another use case for this class performance notebook (or portable workstation) is being a key component in creating content – including moderately advanced video editing.  Performance in Davinci Resolve Studio was vastly improved over my ASUS Zephyrus gaming notebook.  This may be a high-performance laptop targeting gamers, however since video editing stresses some of the same computing components (CPU and GPU) as gaming, this also makes for a premium, high end video editing rig.  Edit screens and functions within Davinci Resolve worked flawlessly, rendering blazingly fast.  No need to reduce a 4k timeline to HD for editing, the Strix handles the workload with ease. No struggles with live previews, timeline refreshes, special effects, fusion components or other GPU intensive activities.  

Pros:
- Large form factor
- Performance oriented, blazing quick CPU and GPU
- Ports: two Thunderbolt 5 ports, HDMI 2.1 port, Three 3.2 Gen 2 USB-A ports, a 2.5gbps ethernet port on this system and a headphone jack.  
- Bright 18 inch 16:10 2.5k IPS non touch screen – high refresh rate
- IR Camera built in, provides you the ability to leverage facial recognition for biometric based logins with Windows Hello.
- Easy remove back panel for access to Memory and SSD slots.

4,"Powerful, large and in charge","As a gaming fan, I was super excited to get my hands on the ASUS ROG Strix G18, an 18"" 2.5K 240Hz gaming laptop with Intel’s new (AeroLake) Core Ultra 9 HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 with 16GB of DDR7 RAM, and a large 2TB PCIe SSD. The Eclipse Gray color is sleek and modern looking, but subdued and, this almost goes without saying, is a powerhouse machine and a great desktop replacement that I was looking for.  Traveling with this beast is possible but weighing in at over 8 lbs. with the power supply, well, there are better options for that need. Additionally, the ASUS ROG Strix G18 comes equipped with 32GB of DDR5 RAM, offering even faster performance and improved multitasking capabilities and easily handled whatever I threw at it. This model runs on Windows 11 home, which provides a smooth and modern user interface. However, I wish it came with Windows 11 Pro instead, as the professional version offers more features and customization options.

One of the first things that caught my eye was the amazing 2.5K (2560x1600) display with a 240Hz refresh rate that is G-SYNC compatible. We gamers know how important smooth and vibrant visuals are, and this laptop totally delivers some impressive eye candy indeed. The colors pop, and my games run smoothly, even in the most intense moments. The 18"" anti-glare screen size is very large, bright (500 nits advertised) and very vibrant as I mentioned before. 
The performance on the ROG Strix G18 is seriously impressive. The Intel Core Ultra 9 HX processor, paired with 32GB of DDR5 RAM, makes multitasking and running heavy applications a breeze. I can switch between gaming, streaming, and other tasks without any lag. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card is top-notch, and when I play COD Black Ops 6, it can sustain a Frame Rate of over 120 and the graphics card temperature hangs around 71 degrees C, that is with the Graphics settings set to Ultra in the game and a resolution of 3440x1440.  When I step that up to the highest setting to Extreme, it dips just a bit to around 110.  Very smooth performance with out any issues or hiccups, and the GPU temperature stays in the acceptable range in my opinion.   I tested with the 3D Mark Time spy and it scored a 20526 high score. 
Storage is usually something I worry about, but the 2TB SSD has more than enough space for all my games, media, and files. The fast read and write speeds mean minimal loading times, so I can jump into my games quicker and stay productive with the tasks that I have to accomplish. 
The laptop's Eclipse Gray finish looks sleek and professional when you turn off the RGB options using the “stealth mode option”, this will turn off the RGB Aura light bar which surrounds the base of the laptop that gives it the appearance of floating on your desk, and also the keyboard RGBs. The main chassis is mostly plastic, and the lid is made of aluminum and allows for a little flex, but despite that it still feels solid overall.  Asus has come up with a great toolless access system to the underside of the laptop that allows for easy upgrades to the RAM and SSD among other components.  You simply slide the rubberized lever and pull towards you to lift it off.  Easy as can be!

The laptop also includes multiple ports, which is great for connecting all of my peripherals. It has two thunderbolt USB Type-C, 3 USB Type-A, HDMI 2.1, and a 2.5G Ethernet port, audio jack, and power input, giving me plenty of options for connecting my gaming accessories and other devices.  The only drawback is that it doesn’t have a SD/MicroSD card slot built in, but that is not a deal breaker for me.
The keyboard is comfortable to type on, great tactile feedback and solid travel for the buttons and has customizable RGB backlighting, and the Q/W/E/R/A/S/D/F and spacebar keys are see-through which adds a cool gaming vibe. The massive trackpad is also a pleasure to use as well with a nice solid clicking feel.
One downside is the weight. At around 8.5 pounds, it’s not the most portable laptop, but the power and performance it provides are worth it. The battery life is decent but not amazing, which is expected with such powerful hardware. I usually have it plugged in while gaming anyway, so it's not a big deal. Another downside is the very average 2MP camera that is built in.  Not the best quality, and it would have been nice to see a much higher resolution camera for this price.
Overall, the ASUS ROG Strix G18 is an incredible gaming laptop that offers top-notch performance, stunning visuals, and plenty of storage. It handles everything I throw at it with ease and provides an immersive gaming experience. If you're looking for a high-end gaming laptop that can tackle the latest games, replace your desktop, and more the ROG Strix G18 is definitely worth checking out and if you register your device with ASUS, you will get a complimentary year of accidental damage as well which is just icing on the cake.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"As a gaming fan, I was super excited to get my hands on the ASUS ROG Strix G18, an 18"" 2.5K 240Hz gaming laptop with Intel’s new (AeroLake) Core Ultra 9 HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 with 16GB of DDR7 RAM, and a large 2TB PCIe SSD.

===  Design and Build Quality  ===

The Asus ROG Strix 18 is my third high-end gaming laptop, and its design and build quality have met my expectations for a device at this price point. It’s a dark and handsome machine with great fit-and-finish and solid build materials. Some people may be disappointed that only the lid is made of metal with the rest being plastic, but I don’t mind it since Asus did not utilize the rough, cheap, and grainy kind of plastic but the kind that feels smooth, hard, and durable. 

The 18” display has relatively slim bezels with excellent brightness, color accuracy, and viewing angles, and with enough room on the top bezel for both a 1080P webcam and an IR module for Windows Hello facial recognition, which I appreciate. The display tech may be IPS but it’s a good one, and I don’t notice a big difference between the 250Hz IPS panel on the ROG Strix 18 and the mini-LED 240Hz panel on my 2024 Acer Predator Helio 18 gaming laptop. As I get older, I appreciate larger displays, and 18” is my favorite display size on a laptop.

The keyboard layout is spacious, and the keys feel soft and gentle with good uptake and snappiness. The Microsoft Precision touchpad is also big and spacious, and it’s an absolute pleasure to use. I like that a numpad was included since I use it when doing my finances and calculations.

Thanks to the variety of ports offered, I can avoid using any dongles and I love it. I appreciate having three USB-A ports (one on the left, two on the right), two USB-C ports, an ethernet port, an audio jack, and an HDMI port. 

Gaming laptops usually come with some bling, and the ROG Strix 18 is no different, with a rectangular LED strip on the bottom panel as well as an RGB keyboard with multiple lighting effects. It’s not too over-the-top nor garish – I think Asus provided just the right amount of bling and customization.

I absolutely love the tool-free, snap on and snap off design of the bottom panel. It made it so simple and easy when I added another 2TB NVME drive. Even the NVME drive doesn’t require any tools or screws as a plastic lever is used to hold down the drive in its slot (see picture). It’s a brilliant design touch from Asus, and I hope all other manufacturers copy and implement these features.

At 7.05 lbs (3.20 kg), the Strix 18 feels heavy, but this is par for the course when it comes to desktop-replacement level gaming laptops, so I won’t knock any points off for that. Just make sure you get a backpack with ample shoulder padding and padded compartments for when traveling with the Strix 18.

All in all, the ROG Strix 18 is easy on the eyes, easy on your hands and joints, and it’s a well-designed laptop that is a pleasure to use.
 
===  Performance  ===

With a 24-core, 24-thread Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 with 16GB of GDDR7 memory, 32GB of DDR5-5600, and a Micron 2TB NVME PCIe 4.0 hard drive, the ROG Strix 18 is a champion of a laptop that can handle pretty much everything in a fast and performant manner. For a machine such as the Strix 18, my primary usage scenario is playing games followed by video editing, and the Strix 18 was very well-equipped to make me a happy customer. I played a variety of games such as Clair Obscure Expedition 33 (turn-based RPG), Dragon Age the Veilguard (action RPG), Stalker 2 (shooter), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (action RPG), Cyberpunk 2077 (shooter), The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered (RPG), and Split Fiction (arcade & puzzler), and the Strix 18 handled all of them very well, delivering high and stable frame rates. The latest DLSS and frame generation technology from Nvidia can boost the framerates higher without much detrimental visual artifacts, and I think it’s a game-changer that will only get better with time.

The Strix 18 comes with Wi-Fi 7 (latest) and Bluetooth 5.4 (latest), and they provide fast and stable speeds for a smooth and lag-free gaming experience. I currently have a Bluetooth keyboard (Corsair K100 Air Wireless), a gamepad (Corsair SCUF Envision controller), and some noise-cancelling headphones (Bose QuietComfort Ultra) connected to the Strix 18, and with the laptop connected to my 55” TV in the living room, it’s a satisfying and fun gaming experience on par with a traditional gaming desktop system.

When it comes to performance, I’m completely content and satisfied, and I expect to use the Strix 18 as my main gaming system for many years to come.

===  Windows, Apps, and Software Experience  ===

At first boot-up, I was kind of annoyed by how long it took to get Windows 11 set up and ready to go. There were many updates to be downloaded and installed, and the laptop was automatically rebooted several times to finish the installations. I know this is good for me and the machine, but I was feeling a bit impatient because I was so excited by the ROG Strix 18 and wanted to unleash the beast as soon as possible. 😊 Thankfully, BIOS and firmware updates did not take as long.

Once all the Windows updates finished and my setting preferences were restored after logging in to Microsoft account, it was smooth sailing afterwards. There is not much bloatware installed, and whatever you don’t want is very easy to uninstall and remove. I only uninstalled one preinstalled app, and it was a video editing software called CapCut from Bytedance due to privacy concerns. 

There are many preinstalled Asus apps but they are useful and don’t take up much space, so I kept them. The Asus Armoury Crate is a good example of an excellent preinstalled manufacturer app, and it offers several useful customization features, such as quickly togging between various fan modes (Windows, Silent, Performance, Turbo, and Manual), setting RGB lighting effects, creating custom performance profiles for apps (e.g., games vs productivity apps), and creation of macros.

Windows 11, compared to Windows 10, still kind of sucks, but I was able to customize it and make it more functional and easier to use by installing the ExplorerPatcher app (by Valinet), which allows for Taskbar and Start Menu customization, among others. Windows 11 has come a long way, and it has been very stable, and I made my peace with it.

===  Everyday Usage and Livability  ===

The ROG Strix 18 is an easy machine to live with and comfortable to interact with. The big, bright 18” screen is very comfortable on the eyes and excellent for gaming, watching movies, working on spreadsheets, and anything else, really – the bigger the screen, the better, I say. 

The touchpad is big and very responsive, and the Microsoft Precision touchpad software makes it easy to customize and create your own touch and tap gestures. 

The keyboard is spaciously laid out and the keys are responsive with good feedback, uptake rate, and organization. I REALLY love that the arrow keys are full-size, and I also appreciate the gaps between the Function keys, which makes quickly finding and tapping on the desired Function key, like the F5 key, much faster and easier to memorize via muscle memory.

When I’m not gaming, I set the operating mode to Silent via the Armoury Crate app, and the Strix 18 becomes either completely silent or whisper quiet while still offering enough power for non-demanding workloads such as office productivity apps, web browsing, and streaming movies and music. For gaming, I press the M4 keyboard button to switch over to the Turbo mode for maximum performance and frames. Doing so does increase the fan noise quite a bit but if you wear headphones or turn up the volume on the soundbar, then it’s a non-issue. 

For a big and heavy 18” gaming laptop, the Strix 18 is surprisingly easy and comfortable to live with, and I have no trouble recommending it as a desktop-replacement machine.

===  Design and Build Quality  ===

The Asus ROG Strix 18 is my third high-end gaming laptop, and its design and build quality have met my expectations for a device at this price point. It’s a dark and handsome machine with great fit-and-finish and solid build materials. Some people may be disappointed that only the lid is made of metal with the rest being plastic, but I don’t mind it since Asus did not utilize the rough, cheap, and grainy kind of plastic but the kind that feels smooth, hard, and durable. 

The 18” display has relatively slim bezels with excellent brightness, color accuracy, and viewing angles, and with enough room on the top bezel for both a 1080P webcam and an IR module for Windows Hello facial recognition, which I appreciate. The display tech may be IPS but it’s a good one, and I don’t notice a big difference between the 250Hz IPS panel on the ROG Strix 18 and the mini-LED 240Hz panel on my 2024 Acer Predator Helio 18 gaming laptop. As I get older, I appreciate larger displays, and 18” is my favorite display size on a laptop.

The keyboard layout is spacious, and the keys feel soft and gentle with good uptake and snappiness. The Microsoft Precision touchpad is also big and spacious, and it’s an absolute pleasure to use. I like that a numpad was included since I use it when doing my finances and calculations.

Thanks to the variety of ports offered, I can avoid using any dongles and I love it. I appreciate having three USB-A ports (one on the left, two on the right), two USB-C ports, an ethernet port, an audio jack, and an HDMI port. 

Gaming laptops usually come with some bling, and the ROG Strix 18 is no different, with a rectangular LED strip on the bottom panel as well as an RGB keyboard with multiple lighting effects. It’s not too over-the-top nor garish – I think Asus provided just the right amount of bling and customization.

I absolutely love the tool-free, snap on and snap off design of the bottom panel. It made it so simple and easy when I added another 2TB NVME drive. Even the NVME drive doesn’t require any tools or screws as a plastic lever is used to hold down the drive in its slot (see picture). It’s a brilliant design touch from Asus, and I hope all other manufacturers copy and implement these features.

At 7.05 lbs (3.20 kg), the Strix 18 feels heavy, but this is par for the course when it comes to desktop-replacement level gaming laptops, so I won’t knock any points off for that. Just make sure you get a backpack with ample shoulder padding and padded compartments for when traveling with the Strix 18.

All in all, the ROG Strix 18 is easy on the eyes, easy on your hands and joints, and it’s a well-designed laptop that is a pleasure to use.
 
===  Performance  ===

With a 24-core, 24-thread Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 with 16GB of GDDR7 memory, 32GB of DDR5-5600, and a Micron 2TB NVME PCIe 4.0 hard drive, the ROG Strix 18 is a champion of a laptop that can handle pretty much everything in a fast and performant manner. For a machine such as the Strix 18, my primary usage scenario is playing games followed by video editing, and the Strix 18 was very well-equipped to make me a happy customer. I played a variety of games such as Clair Obscure Expedition 33 (turn-based RPG), Dragon Age the Veilguard (action RPG), Stalker 2 (shooter), Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (action RPG), Cyberpunk 2077 (shooter), The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered (RPG), and Split Fiction (arcade & puzzler), and the Strix 18 handled all of them very well, delivering high and stable frame rates. The latest DLSS and frame generation technology from Nvidia can boost the framerates higher without much detrimental visual artifacts, and I think it’s a game-changer that will only get better with time.

The Strix 18 comes with Wi-Fi 7 (latest) and Bluetooth 5.4 (latest), and they provide fast and stable speeds for a smooth and lag-free gaming experience. I currently have a Bluetooth keyboard (Corsair K100 Air Wireless), a gamepad (Corsair SCUF Envision controller), and some noise-cancelling headphones (Bose QuietComfort Ultra) connected to the Strix 18, and with the laptop connected to my 55” TV in the living room, it’s a satisfying and fun gaming experience on par with a traditional gaming desktop system.

When it comes to performance, I’m completely content and satisfied, and I expect to use the Strix 18 as my main gaming system for many years to come.

===  Windows, Apps, and Software Experience  ===

At first boot-up, I was kind of annoyed by how long it took to get Windows 11 set up and ready to go. There were many updates to be downloaded and installed, and the laptop was automatically rebooted several times to finish the installations. I know this is good for me and the machine, but I was feeling a bit impatient because I was so excited by the ROG Strix 18 and wanted to unleash the beast as soon as possible. 😊 Thankfully, BIOS and firmware updates did not take as long.

Once all the Windows updates finished and my setting preferences were restored after logging in to Microsoft account, it was smooth sailing afterwards. There is not much bloatware installed, and whatever you don’t want is very easy to uninstall and remove. I only uninstalled one preinstalled app, and it was a video editing software called CapCut from Bytedance due to privacy concerns. 

There are many preinstalled Asus apps but they are useful and don’t take up much space, so I kept them. The Asus Armoury Crate is a good example of an excellent preinstalled manufacturer app, and it offers several useful customization features, such as quickly togging between various fan modes (Windows, Silent, Performance, Turbo, and Manual), setting RGB lighting effects, creating custom performance profiles for apps (e.g., games vs productivity apps), and creation of macros.

Windows 11, compared to Windows 10, still kind of sucks, but I was able to customize it and make it more functional and easier to use by installing the ExplorerPatcher app (by Valinet), which allows for Taskbar and Start Menu customization, among others. Windows 11 has come a long way, and it has been very stable, and I made my peace with it.

===  Everyday Usage and Livability  ===

The ROG Strix 18 is an easy machine to live with and comfortable to interact with. The big, bright 18” screen is very comfortable on the eyes and excellent for gaming, watching movies, working on spreadsheets, and anything else, really – the bigger the screen, the better, I say. 

The touchpad is big and very responsive, and the Microsoft Precision touchpad software makes it easy to customize and create your own touch and tap gestures. 

The keyboard is spaciously laid out and the keys are responsive with good feedback, uptake rate, and organization. I REALLY love that the arrow keys are full-size, and I also appreciate the gaps between the Function keys, which makes quickly finding and tapping on the desired Function key, like the F5 key, much faster and easier to memorize via muscle memory.

5,Portable Upgradable Power,"This ASUS ROG Strix laptop is a BEAST!  It has the power to handle just about any game you throw at it while still being portable. The roomy gaming-inspired keyboard and beautiful 18” 2.5K 240Hz screen makes remote gameplay immersive and fluid.  When it’s time to upgrade the already powerful components like the memory or  storage, you just pop open the bottom cover, no tools needed.

Highlights:
* Impressive unboxing experience.
* Sleek and attractive design.
* 380W power adapter!
* Relatively slim for a laptop with an 18” screen.
* Bright and fluid 18” 2560x1600 screen.
* Easy-access tool-less bottom cover for upgrades.
* Easy to replace RAM, Storage or Battery.
* Massive cooling that is quiet even at higher speeds.
* Full keyboard with special hotkeys and numeric keypad.
* Fun but classy RGB keyboard and underside lighting.
* Tons of ports; RF-45 Ethernet, HDMI, USB-C, USB-A, Headphones 
* Built-in Webcam and Microphones.

Room for Improvement:
* Huge power adapter with a proprietary connector to the laptop.
* Single power port on the left side of the notebook.


Setup:

This thing is impressive even before you even set it up or power it on.  Open the box and the laptop is presented like a jewel.  As the lid to the box is opened, the laptop rises on an elevated platform - presenting you with your prize.  The inside of the lid has illustrations that highlight some of the cool features of this laptop and are almost framable. There’s not much in the box - just the laptop, the substantial power adapter and the removable power cord.  A few small pieces of paper are there but don’t have much you need.

Once you remove this laptop from the box, the rest is straightforward.  Plug the huge power adapter into the wall and the port on the left side of the laptop and start going through Windows setup.  Once done, you’re greeting with your new gaming beast.  Note that the special power port is only on the left side of the notebook.


Usage:

I’ve been using this laptop for a little while now, and it’s honestly one of the better gaming laptops I’ve come across. Right out of the box, it feels solid and well-built—definitely not flimsy. It’s a bit on the heavier side, but that’s expected with the kind of hardware it’s packing.

Performance-wise, it handles everything I’ve thrown at it. Whether it's newer AAA games, some video editing, or running multiple apps at once, it doesn't lag or stutter. The combination of a high-end Intel processor and an RTX graphics card really shows when you’re pushing it hard.

Games run smoothly even on high settings, and the high-refresh-rate screen makes everything look super fluid—great if you're into fast-paced titles.  The display itself is surprisingly good. Colors are sharp, brightness is decent even during the day, and it's just a pleasure to use for both gaming and general stuff like watching videos or editing photos.  The roomy keyboard feels nice too—responsive with good travel—and there's customizable RGB lighting if you’re into that.

I’ve also been using it to run local language models with Ollama, and it performs better than I expected. Models like LLaMA 3 or Mistral load up fast and respond quickly, especially with GPU acceleration enabled. The 32GB of RAM helps a lot, and the RTX 5080 GPU cuts inference times significantly. If you're into local AI workflows, this laptop can absolutely handle it without needing cloud compute. It’s great for experimentation, coding assistance, or even running small private chatbots.

It does get a little loud when it's working hard, especially when gaming or rendering, but the cooling system keeps the temperatures in check. You’ll hear the fans, but they’re doing their job. I wouldn’t say it runs hot, just audible under load.

Battery life is about what you'd expect for a gaming laptop. It’ll get you through a few hours of light use—web browsing, writing, maybe some Netflix—but once you start gaming or doing heavier tasks, you’ll want to keep it plugged in.  The huge adapter has plenty of power to keep the laptop running under full load, but it does add a bit of heft to your travel bag.

One thing I appreciate is that it comes with a good range of ports—USB-C, HDMI, Ethernet, the usuals—so I never felt like I needed a dongle or hub. And the Wi-Fi is fast and stable, which makes a difference in online games and large file downloads.

The RGB keyboard is a bit gimmicky.  The see-through keycaps are not uniform so you get light and dark areas.  The trackpad is large and a trackpad, either you love them or hate them.


Overall: 
This laptop is intended to be an all-in-one gaming beast that you can either set up on a table with limited space or take with you anywhere inspiration hits.  It has more than enough guts to speed through just about any task you throw at it.  When the time comes to increase the memory or storage, the tool-less bottom cover pops off without feeling like you’re voiding a warranty or breaking anything.

the left side of the laptop and start going through windows setup once done you re greeting with your new gaming beast note that the special power port is only on the left side of the notebook usage i ve been using this laptop for a little while now and it s honestly one of the better gaming laptops i ve come across right out of the box it feels solid and well built definitely not flimsy it s a bit on the heavier side but that s expected with the kind of hardware it s packing performance wise it handles everything i ve thrown at it whether it s newer aaa games some video editing or running multiple apps at once it doesn t lag or stutter the combination of a high end intel processor and an rtx graphics card really shows when you re pushing it hard games run smoothly even on high settings and the high refresh rate screen makes everything look super fluid great if you re into fast paced titles the display itself is surprisingly good colors are sharp brightness is decent even during the day and it s just a pleasure to use for both gaming and general stuff like watching videos or editing photos the roomy keyboard feels nice too responsive with good travel and there s customizable rgb lighting if you re into that i ve also been using it to run local language models with ollama and it performs better than i expected models like llama 3 or mistral load up fast and respond quickly especially with gpu acceleration enabled the 32gb of ram helps a lot and the rtx 5080 gpu cuts inference times significantly if you re into local ai workflows this laptop can absolutely handle it without needing cloud compute it s great for experimentation coding assistance or even running small private chatbots it does get a little loud when it s working hard especially when gaming or rendering but the cooling system keeps the temperatures in check you ll hear the fans but they re doing their job i wouldn t say it runs hot just audible under load battery life is about what you d expect for a gaming laptop it ll get you through a few hours of light use web browsing writing maybe some netflix but once you start gaming or doing heavier tasks you ll want to keep it plugged in the huge adapter has plenty of power to keep the laptop running under full load but it does add a bit of heft to your travel bag one thing i appreciate is that it comes with a good range of ports usb c hdmi ethernet the usuals so i never felt like i needed a dongle or hub and the wi fi is fast and stable which makes a difference in online games and large file downloads the rgb keyboard is a bit gimmicky the see through keycaps are not uniform so you get light and dark areas the trackpad is large and a trackpad either you love them or hate them overall this laptop is intended to be an all in one gaming beast that you can either set up on a table with limited space or take with you anywhere inspiration hits it has more than enough guts to speed through just about any task you throw at it when the time comes to increase the memory or storage the tool less bottom cover pops off without feeling like you re voiding a warranty or breaking anything a huge fluid screen all the ports you need power to spare easy upgradability all in a slim and portable chassis,5,1.0,POSITIVE,0.9946650266647339,0.9946650266647339,0.9973325133323669,0.9973325133323669,1,1,1
5,Incredible performance and nice form factor,"Asus has been doing so well lately with their hardware choices, and the ROG Strix G18 is no exception. It includes some of the absolute best performance components you could as for in a gaming laptop, and still manages to be reasonably compact, especially for an 18"" laptop. 

- Hardware/Design

The laptop itself, while maybe a bit thicker than other modern laptops, but doesn't feel cumbersome or too heavy. It feels like a higher-end device where many considerations were made to deliver the best end result. My favorite of which, being the toolless access to upgrade the laptop by simply hitting the release and opening the entire bottom of the laptop to swap out components. Very, very cool. While the 32GB of RAM is excellent, I may upgrade this, just because it is so easy to do. Slotting in an additional 32GB of RAM in the unused slot is an easy upgrade. The 2TB SSD is also excellent, but with the option to upgrade it down the road, it's something to consider too.

I also really like the way the lighting can be subtle and reactive with what you're doing. Whether it's reacting to performance or audio, it's a very nice touch. The lighting may not be for everyone and can easily but disabled as well.

One of the benefits of the larger form factor in this 18"" laptop, you can the added benefit of a numeric keypad, which can be great, especially if you do any sort of 3d work, like in Blender. The trackpad is also nice and large. It's smooth to use as well. The backlit RGB keyboard is also cool. Offering the same reactive color the bottom lighting does.

The ports on offer are also a nice touch. Especially having an ethernet port built in. This just makes every aspect of gaming able to reach the best performance possible.

The screen and audio are also standouts. the screen is nice and bright, it's also capable of some very high refresh rates (240hz), which is excellent when paired with some of the higher frames this laptop is capable of. Speakers are also much better than you may expect. They're rated for Dolby Atmos, and they sound great during use. Lots of clear highs and a surprising amount of bass.

- Performance

If you're looking for a top performing laptop, this is near the best you can get. I believe there is a model with an RTX 5090 as well, but I think the value for performance is probably better with the RTX 5080. The Intel Core Ultra 9 seems up to the task as well. Since the CPU is equally as important when it comes to gaming and other intensive tasks. I have been pushing this laptop pretty hard, and its performance has far exceeded my expectations. As far as gaming goes, I think Cyberpunk 2077 is still one of the games that pushes hardware to its limits. I tested both on the laptop screen itself, and outputting at 4K. Utilizing some of the new DLSS tech these 50 series cards are capable of, like frame generation I was getting very impressive numbers. I was able to get over 100 FPS at 4K with ray tracing and nearly everything maxed out. Using the laptop screen at 2560x1600, I was able to get well over 180 FPS. Other games are easily performing well at maximum settings. Maxing out Forza Motorsport, with all raytracing, I was able to get 60FPS, and this is without utilizing DLSS at all. Enabling DLSS, I was able to push the framerate much higher. If I made a few extra tweaks, it would be fairly easy to get 120 FPS. The fans weren't too overpowering either, even when being pushed too hard. They are noticeable, of course, but not as loud as other gaming laptops that I have used. One final note, on the battery life. When not gaming, and not pushing that Nvidia card, the laptop can get some reasonable battery life. However, like any other gaming laptop, when being pushed hard, you're likely to need to keep the charger handy. I was getting a little under 2 hours during some gaming sessions. I do like the option to put the laptop in a battery health mode, that keeps its charge under 80% to help preserve the battery when it's being kept plugged in, which is what I often do. Using it for gaming while I'm home and plugged in, then take it with me on trips.

If you're looking for a gaming laptop with no compromise, this is easy to recommend.

Pros: Comfortable to use, nice build, excellent performance, great screen, clean sounding audio, lots of ports (including ethernet), excellent upgradeability with easy to open case.

Cons: Battery life isn't always the greatest when gaming, even though it's a large (18"") laptop, I still wouldn't mind if there was room to shave off some of the size.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"Asus has been doing so well lately with their hardware choices, and the ROG Strix G18 is no exception.

What went right:
1. The screen size was amazing. The 18"" helps you feel immersive and allows you to see things clearly. 
2. I also enjoyed the lighting around the laptop because it added pops of color that I appreciated. There is nothing else positive about this laptop. 
3. The laptop never got hot. At least not to where I would notice

What went wrong:
1. I was unable to connect Bluetooth headphones without games getting a hang error.
2. My screen would go black and then get status
3. The laptop would just turn off
4. I contacted ASUS and they said lets update the bios. Once I did this the computer then started shutting off once an hour no matter what I was playing or doing. 
5. The error longs showed I was facing a problem with ""Blue Screen,"" but when I test the system it says everything is working fine. 
6. Customer service could have been sigificantly better, but instead they said it could take up to 4 weeks to fix and at that point the return period would be over.

Overall, on paper this laptop is one of the best, but I found it didn't work for me. It could very much all be software, but I don't have time to sit around and fin out.

5,A Portable Gaming Powerhouse,"A Portable Gaming Powerhouse

PROS

+ Blazing fast gaming performance
+ Solid battery life when not gaming with smart GPU switching
+ Great cooling, especially by gaming laptop standards (e.g. won’t burn you to touch laptop deck while gaming)
+ 240hz high-refresh rate screen has great motion resolution
+ 5080 laptop GPU is full wattage version (175w) & supports all of the latest Nvidia DLSS features, which work amazingly well in games which support them
+ Great I/O selection, including two thunderbolt 5 ports
+ Tool-free entry to internals is amazing if trying to access things like SSD storage
+ Great use of RGB under the laptop & keyboard (as someone who doesn’t like overly gamer looking laptops)
+ Solid (& heavy) build quality and materials, with very minimal screen flex and strong hinge for lid

CONS

- Fans can get quite loud as heat & fan speed increases (I recommend staying away from Turbo mode unless you have a good pair of noise cancelling headphones)
- Chassis is a bit of a fingerprint/grease magnet

SO-SO

* Keyboard keys are serviceable, but not the best laptop keyboard I have used for long typing sessions. Works well for gaming though
* Screen picture quality is fine, but far from the best I have seen on a laptop from a contrast and color perspective. For this much expense, it would have been nice to have a more vivid screen. Great viewing angles though if that matters for you.
* There is no getting around the fact that this is an expensive device. You get what you pay for though

THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT

UNBOXING

The Asus ROG Strix G18 is a beast, both physically and from a gaming perspective. Normally I don’t pay much attention to packaging (I unbox everything and don’t really remember it the moment it's gone), but this laptop sets the stage right from the start with the most unique unboxing of a laptop I have had. It comes in this cardboard box, which when opened, has a mechanism that lifts the laptop up on a small cardboard platform as the box lid is raised, like it is presenting the laptop to you. Above the platformed laptop on the lid is a graphic design showcasing everything the laptop has to offer from a hardware perspective. It’s a small touch, and has nothing to do with the laptop itself, but is without a doubt impressionable and sets a great first impression for the device. When a laptop costs a premium, it helps when the unboxing experience feels above and beyond.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS & SET-UP

From a hardware & I/O perspective, you get a lot here. To start, because this isn’t trying to be a thin and light laptop, you get the benefit of a lot more I/O than a lot of modern laptops. Specifically, you get a 3.5mm headphone jack, 2.5G ethernet port, 3x USB-A 3.2 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, and 2x Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, along with a power input port for the custom Asus Power Adapter (it can charge as a slower rate over USB-C as well). The dual thunderbolt 5 ports are a particular benefit for me here, given how rare they still are on modern PCs and how much bandwidth (80Gbps bi-directional or 120 Gbps uni-directional), they offer compared to Thunderbolt 4. This can be used to power higher resolution/refresh rate displays, but could also help future proof the laptop a bit when thunderbolt 5 based eGPUs become more common.

On the build quality side, it feels quite premium, with a mostly metal and hard plastic chassis. The screen hinge in particular is something that stood out to me, it feels very strong and actually doesn’t let you open the screen one-handed (which is surprising given how heavy the base is), since it actually lifts the base with it. There is very minimal screen flex, and the screen itself looks pretty good. Asus calls it the “Nebula Display”, which can display 500 nits of peak brightness and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut. It also comes with an anti-glare coating which is almost matte looking. The result is a display that gets plenty bright, has good viewing angles, and combats reflections quite well. Combined with the 240hz refresh rate it feels very snappy for gaming. Where I think the display falls short for me is in the contrast, as it still feels like an IPS display. Coming from using OLED and mini-LED displays, it is a far cry from that level of picture quality, and while you can still go up in trims to get a SCAR model with the nicer display, it would have been nice if this more “base” G18 model had a bit nicer of a display from a contrast perspective. Again, it’s not bad at all, but for my standards, I think it is “acceptable”, which on a premium gaming laptop, can be more or less acceptable depending on your preferences. I tend to use external monitors already for 90% of my gaming, so it isn’t a big issue for me.

I also want to mention two other quick hardware things that I think are nice touches. The first is the RGB, which I think is nicely done using a lightbar that runs the full perimeter of the bottom of the laptop, and reflects on the tabletop (as well as doubles as the light for the keyboard backlight). It's not too showy, but gives a nice flair to the laptop that is totally unique. The second thing I really liked is that the laptop features this Q-latch system which allows you to open the bottom of the laptop quickly without any screws. It's so much nicer than dealing with tiny screws you might lose, and it makes it easier if you are trying to clean the laptop, add additional storage, or for maintenance. It's a small touch, but very nicely implemented.

On the software side, if you have ever set-up any PC with Windows, then you know what the set-up process for this device is like, so I won’t go into too many details here. What I will say is that the webcam works quite well with Windows Hello, and you do have a fair amount of Asus software pre-installed that you need to configure. I am generally not a fan of pre-installed bloatware, but I do think Asus does it better than most, with MyAsus being the general device software for managing system settings/updates, and Armory Crate being the gaming center for things like performance mode tuning, RBG, game library, and more. I am generally a fan of Armory Crate, although it can be a bit laggy at points, but it is far from unusable and keeps things simple. Apart from this, there was minimal additional software pre-loaded, and you can configure your additional gaming software (Steam, Epic, Razer, etc.), to your liking.

GAMING EXPERIENCE

What matters more than anything, when investing in a gaming laptop, is how it performs playing games, and thankfully this is where the Strix G18 exceeded my expectations. With a laptop 5080 (at the full 175W TGP), and an Intel Ultra 9, you are getting some of the best mobile hardware you can get for gaming, but where this tends to fall apart for me with gaming laptops is heat & noise. I am happy to say though that I think Asus has done a great job with cooling. It has a tri-fan design and a vapor chamber design that extends all throughout the laptop, with a fairly thick heatsink. Heat is vented out the back which keeps the keyboard deck from getting too hot. I played the laptop via wall power in the Performance power profile, and found that the GPU was surprisingly staying around 70C when gaming and while the CPU was getting warmer near 85-90C, it never tended to exceed that mark too far in my longer gaming sessions. What was more surprising though was that while the fans can get quite audible in performance mode, I didn’t find them unbearable. I would of course recommend using headphones, but the fans didn’t need to be full blast to achieve acceptable heat. I would say to stay away from Turbo mode though, which is the exception to this rule for me. In my benchmarks I found that you get at most around 5-6% more FPS, but at the cost of full fan-speed and heat which to me doesn’t feel worth it.

In terms of performance benchmarks, I ran several games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, The Quarry, & a few more games. Across the board gaming was great to exceptional. In games which support all of the latest Nvidia features, like Cyberpunk & Indiana Jones, it can perform its best. DLSS multi-frame gen is almost like magic with how well it increases the fluidness of motion without introducing much additional latency. I tend to play using a TV with a controller typically, and in these cases I couldn’t tell any difference in latency, but the visual fluidity was massively improved with minimal to no noticeable artifacts. Coming from a laptop with a 4080, the typical performance in games without DLSS features, like the Quarry, wasn’t as huge of a difference. However, in games which support these features, it really makes the experience much better. For example, with every setting maxed (including path tracing) in Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to regularly get 80-100fps (~40-45 fps before frame gen) using multi-frame gen. While a laptop will never be able to scale to the heights of a desktop in terms of raw gaming performance, this really does feel like a desktop replacement, with AAA quality performance, top-end features, and great cooling, while also still being portable. Definitely the best gaming mobile gaming experience I have had to date.

CONCLUSION

The G18 has so many things it does right. The hardware looks and feels top-notch, cooling is great by laptop standards, I/O is full-featured, gaming performance is excellent, and it does it all well. Yes, I think the software could be a bit better (but you can only do so much with Windows), the screen contrast could be better at this price point, and at full power the fans can get very loud. But all of these cons feel negligible for me in the face of all of the pros. You get a gaming laptop to game, and this is where the G18 is at its best. If you are in the market for a high-end gaming laptop and don’t have size constraints, I think this is an excellent choice.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"A Portable Gaming Powerhouse

+ 5080 laptop GPU is full wattage version (175w) & supports all of the latest Nvidia DLSS features, which work amazingly well in games which support them
+ Great I/O selection, including two thunderbolt 5 ports
+ Tool-free entry to internals is amazing if trying to access things like SSD storage
+ Great use of RGB under the laptop & keyboard (as someone who doesn’t like overly gamer looking laptops)
+ Solid (& heavy) build quality and materials, with very minimal screen flex and strong hinge for lid

CONS

- Fans can get quite loud as heat & fan speed increases (I recommend staying away from Turbo mode unless you have a good pair of noise cancelling headphones)
- Chassis is a bit of a fingerprint/grease magnet

SO-SO

* Keyboard keys are serviceable, but not the best laptop keyboard I have used for long typing sessions. Works well for gaming though
* Screen picture quality is fine, but far from the best I have seen on a laptop from a contrast and color perspective. For this much expense, it would have been nice to have a more vivid screen. Great viewing angles though if that matters for you.
* There is no getting around the fact that this is an expensive device. You get what you pay for though

THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT

UNBOXING

The Asus ROG Strix G18 is a beast, both physically and from a gaming perspective. Normally I don’t pay much attention to packaging (I unbox everything and don’t really remember it the moment it's gone), but this laptop sets the stage right from the start with the most unique unboxing of a laptop I have had. It comes in this cardboard box, which when opened, has a mechanism that lifts the laptop up on a small cardboard platform as the box lid is raised, like it is presenting the laptop to you. Above the platformed laptop on the lid is a graphic design showcasing everything the laptop has to offer from a hardware perspective. It’s a small touch, and has nothing to do with the laptop itself, but is without a doubt impressionable and sets a great first impression for the device. When a laptop costs a premium, it helps when the unboxing experience feels above and beyond.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS & SET-UP

From a hardware & I/O perspective, you get a lot here. To start, because this isn’t trying to be a thin and light laptop, you get the benefit of a lot more I/O than a lot of modern laptops. Specifically, you get a 3.5mm headphone jack, 2.5G ethernet port, 3x USB-A 3.2 ports, an HDMI 2.1 port, and 2x Thunderbolt 5 USB-C ports, along with a power input port for the custom Asus Power Adapter (it can charge as a slower rate over USB-C as well). The dual thunderbolt 5 ports are a particular benefit for me here, given how rare they still are on modern PCs and how much bandwidth (80Gbps bi-directional or 120 Gbps uni-directional), they offer compared to Thunderbolt 4. This can be used to power higher resolution/refresh rate displays, but could also help future proof the laptop a bit when thunderbolt 5 based eGPUs become more common.

On the build quality side, it feels quite premium, with a mostly metal and hard plastic chassis. The screen hinge in particular is something that stood out to me, it feels very strong and actually doesn’t let you open the screen one-handed (which is surprising given how heavy the base is), since it actually lifts the base with it. There is very minimal screen flex, and the screen itself looks pretty good. Asus calls it the “Nebula Display”, which can display 500 nits of peak brightness and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut. It also comes with an anti-glare coating which is almost matte looking. The result is a display that gets plenty bright, has good viewing angles, and combats reflections quite well. Combined with the 240hz refresh rate it feels very snappy for gaming. Where I think the display falls short for me is in the contrast, as it still feels like an IPS display. Coming from using OLED and mini-LED displays, it is a far cry from that level of picture quality, and while you can still go up in trims to get a SCAR model with the nicer display, it would have been nice if this more “base” G18 model had a bit nicer of a display from a contrast perspective. Again, it’s not bad at all, but for my standards, I think it is “acceptable”, which on a premium gaming laptop, can be more or less acceptable depending on your preferences. I tend to use external monitors already for 90% of my gaming, so it isn’t a big issue for me.

I also want to mention two other quick hardware things that I think are nice touches. The first is the RGB, which I think is nicely done using a lightbar that runs the full perimeter of the bottom of the laptop, and reflects on the tabletop (as well as doubles as the light for the keyboard backlight). It's not too showy, but gives a nice flair to the laptop that is totally unique. The second thing I really liked is that the laptop features this Q-latch system which allows you to open the bottom of the laptop quickly without any screws. It's so much nicer than dealing with tiny screws you might lose, and it makes it easier if you are trying to clean the laptop, add additional storage, or for maintenance. It's a small touch, but very nicely implemented.

On the software side, if you have ever set-up any PC with Windows, then you know what the set-up process for this device is like, so I won’t go into too many details here. What I will say is that the webcam works quite well with Windows Hello, and you do have a fair amount of Asus software pre-installed that you need to configure. I am generally not a fan of pre-installed bloatware, but I do think Asus does it better than most, with MyAsus being the general device software for managing system settings/updates, and Armory Crate being the gaming center for things like performance mode tuning, RBG, game library, and more. I am generally a fan of Armory Crate, although it can be a bit laggy at points, but it is far from unusable and keeps things simple. Apart from this, there was minimal additional software pre-loaded, and you can configure your additional gaming software (Steam, Epic, Razer, etc.), to your liking.

GAMING EXPERIENCE

What matters more than anything, when investing in a gaming laptop, is how it performs playing games, and thankfully this is where the Strix G18 exceeded my expectations. With a laptop 5080 (at the full 175W TGP), and an Intel Ultra 9, you are getting some of the best mobile hardware you can get for gaming, but where this tends to fall apart for me with gaming laptops is heat & noise. I am happy to say though that I think Asus has done a great job with cooling. It has a tri-fan design and a vapor chamber design that extends all throughout the laptop, with a fairly thick heatsink. Heat is vented out the back which keeps the keyboard deck from getting too hot. I played the laptop via wall power in the Performance power profile, and found that the GPU was surprisingly staying around 70C when gaming and while the CPU was getting warmer near 85-90C, it never tended to exceed that mark too far in my longer gaming sessions. What was more surprising though was that while the fans can get quite audible in performance mode, I didn’t find them unbearable. I would of course recommend using headphones, but the fans didn’t need to be full blast to achieve acceptable heat. I would say to stay away from Turbo mode though, which is the exception to this rule for me. In my benchmarks I found that you get at most around 5-6% more FPS, but at the cost of full fan-speed and heat which to me doesn’t feel worth it.

In terms of performance benchmarks, I ran several games, including Cyberpunk 2077, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, The Quarry, & a few more games. Across the board gaming was great to exceptional. In games which support all of the latest Nvidia features, like Cyberpunk & Indiana Jones, it can perform its best. DLSS multi-frame gen is almost like magic with how well it increases the fluidness of motion without introducing much additional latency. I tend to play using a TV with a controller typically, and in these cases I couldn’t tell any difference in latency, but the visual fluidity was massively improved with minimal to no noticeable artifacts. Coming from a laptop with a 4080, the typical performance in games without DLSS features, like the Quarry, wasn’t as huge of a difference. However, in games which support these features, it really makes the experience much better. For example, with every setting maxed (including path tracing) in Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to regularly get 80-100fps (~40-45 fps before frame gen) using multi-frame gen. While a laptop will never be able to scale to the heights of a desktop in terms of raw gaming performance, this really does feel like a desktop replacement, with AAA quality performance, top-end features, and great cooling, while also still being portable. Definitely the best gaming mobile gaming experience I have had to date.

CONCLUSION

The G18 has so many things it does right. The hardware looks and feels top-notch, cooling is great by laptop standards, I/O is full-featured, gaming performance is excellent, and it does it all well. Yes, I think the software could be a bit better (but you can only do so much with Windows), the screen contrast could be better at this price point, and at full power the fans can get very loud. But all of these cons feel negligible for me in the face of all of the pros. You get a gaming laptop to game, and this is where the G18 is at its best. If you are in the market for a high-end gaming laptop and don’t have size constraints, I think this is an excellent choice.",a portable gaming powerhouse pros blazing fast gaming performance solid

5,Outstanding Performer,"The ASUS ROG Strix G18 gaming laptop is a powerhouse for gaming.  The G18 chewed through my favorite games like a hot knife threw butter.  Its 3Dmark Time Spy benchmark score was 22,827.  The Mobile 5080’s individual score was 21,815 while the Intel Ultra 9 275HX CPU score was 16,574.  I keep reading reviews about how weak the Intel Ultra 9 is for gaming.  Not only did this CPU bench well.  It games well.

Gaming:

Mechwarrior Online, or MWO for short is a Direct X 9/11 game that is about 12 years old.  It is also the game I play the most and am the most familiar with.  There is No DLSS, no Ray Tracing, and no ALLM.  Instead, this game is solidly in the class of system destroying, brute force, high horsepower graphics rendering that leverages TXAA anti-aliasing, Post-Processing, and, of course, max fidelity settings.  Well, it was back in its day.  At 2560x1600, the G18 completely owned MWO.  FPS ranged from 130 to 90 with an average of around 100 FPS.  In my experience, 130 is where this game tops out.  Considering how poorly optimized this game is, 100 to 130 is perfect.  Better yet, I was able to maintain this performance connected to my external 34” 1440 monitor.    

Next, Diablo IV.  This game runs great at medium high settings with DLSS turned on.  DLSS is fine when walking around a town.  When bossing or in a tough fight, where timing is everything, then DLSS simply gets in the way, and in some cases, will get your character killed.  With DLSS on, I was steady around 130 FPS.  With DLSS off, the G18 was able to maintain a steady 100 or higher FPS.  Graphics settings were set to medium-high with some Ray Tracing on.  

Finally, Call of Duty Black Ops 6.  The first thing I did was run the built-in benchmark/calibration routine.  I posted a screenshot so you can see all the numbers.  The system scored 150 with DLSS on and 136 with DLSS off.  For competitive play, turn DLSS off.  It will save you a lot of frustration.  Actual game play, the FPS hovered around 100 FPS.  This was more than good enough to remain competitive.  There was not screen tearing, no lag, and not ghosting on the screen.  I actually had some of my best matches on the G18.  That is, after I turned off DLSS.  With DLSS on, I had some of my worst matches due to the lag or delay in real time, screen rendered information.  

Overall, less DLSS, my gaming experience was excellent.  DLSS has its place.  Just not in online competitive gaming.

Fan Noise:

The G18 has five power profile modes that directly impact system noise.  Amory Crate has three pre-configured profiles: Silent, Performance, and Turbo.  Amory Crate also has a mode that works directly with Windows Power Plan.  Finally, there is the option to build your own power profile.  Silent is exactly that.  Fans are off.  The system will get warm but not hot.  Performance mode has a range from quiet to loud depending on system load.  Energy consumption increases on the system.  This in turn causes more heat which demands the fans run to keep the system cool.  While gaming, the fans ramped up to about 80% to 90%.  I would recommend a good pair of noise canceling headphones while gaming.  Turbo mode is full peak system power, peak heat, and peak leaf blower fan performance.  At 100%, the G18 fans are loud.  Headphones with good noise isolation is required.  The fans running at 100% does a good job of keeping up with the heat.  But, the system will still heat up and you will run into CPU throttling.  

Overall, I feel that the Performance pre-set power profile is an excellent balance between energy consumption, heat management, and performance.  

Keyboard and RGB lighting:

The keyboard is well laid out, comfortable to type and game on, and the keys have a good resistance and return.  The only thing I do not like about this keyboard are the translucent Q, W, E, R, A, S, D, F, and space bar keys.  In a dark room, or a room with poor lighting, it is nearly impossible to read the silk screened letter on the key cap.  I found this challenging in situations where I need to see the key.  For example, I use a rare key function in one of my games and want to visually confirm before pressing the key.  Not all my games are FPS games.  This is not an issue in a well-lit room. 

The RGB, as a whole, is very well done.  The letters, number, and words on the regular key caps are shine through.  And each key cap allows light to purposely blead around the edges.  The bottom of the G18 has four RGB light strips that can either coordinate with the keyboard RGB or act independent of the keyboard.  I kept them on for a few days and then turned them off.  The RGB strips are well done, well placed, and cast a lot of light.  Asus provides a way to change RGB via some presets.  It also provides the ability to turn the lighting off.  One place where Asus seems to keep missing the mark is keyboard lighting customization.  Aura Creator is a nice to have, assuming it will even detect your keyboard and chassis light bars, but it is insanely difficult to use to any effect.  And tying custom profiles to games has always been a hit or miss exercise.  

Sound:

The speakers are clear and good enough for laptop speakers.  They won’t compete with a dedicated headset or dedicated external speakers.  They are good enough for YouTube, pod casts, Netflix, internet radio, and other leisurely listening activities.  While gaming, the fan noise will overwhelm the speaker audio quality.  They are still useful for gaming.  However, the competition with the fan noise will eventually force you into a headset.

Screen Performance:

I think Asus nailed it with the screen.  Colors are bright and vibrant.  The refresh rate at 240Hz is excellent. I did not notice any ghosting, artifacts, or screen tearing while gaming.  Even the fast twitch movements associated with playing CoD6 was clean, fast, and completely immersive.  The only thing that would make my experience better is upgrading the laptop’s screen to an OLED.  Or connecting to an external OLED gaming monitor.

Upgradability:

I upgrade my laptops.  Back in the day, laptops had doors and drawers to access hard drives, memory, CD players, and batteries.  Today, everything has screws and plastic clamps which are time consuming, difficult to work with, and can often lead to scratches or other unintended damage.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Asus for bringing “easy” back to user-accessible upgrades.  The bottom cover has a latch that slides, clicks, and then the bottom cover simply slides off.  It could not be any easier.  Ram, battery, and SSD slots are easily accessible.  The main board is protected by a secondary plastic cover.  

Final thoughts:

This is a beast of a system.  The system will get warm regardless of what power mode is selected.  Under load, the system fans get loud.  Gaming performance is excellent.  Daily productivity is excellent.  There are power saving features, such as CPU Core Configuration and nVidia Optimus, that will help make this laptop perfect as a workstation and gaming computer replacement.  Overall, I am very happy with the G18.  I think it is an excellent system.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"The ASUS ROG Strix G18 gaming laptop is a powerhouse for gaming.

Overall, I am very happy with the G18.  I think it is an excellent system.",the asus rog strix g18 gaming laptop is a powerhouse for gaming the g18 chewed through my favorite games like a hot knife threw butter its 3dmark time spy benchmark score was 22 827 the mobile 5080 s individual score was 21 815 while the intel ultra 9 275hx cpu score was 16 574 i keep reading reviews about how weak the intel ultra 9 is for gaming not only did this cpu bench well it games well gaming mechwarrior online or mwo for short is a direct x 9 11 game that is about 12 years old it is also the game i play the most and am the most familiar with there is no dlss no ray tracing and no allm instead this game is solidly in the class of system destroying brute force high horsepower graphics rendering that leverages txaa anti aliasing post processing and of course max fidelity settings well it was back in its day at 2560x1600 the g18 completely owned mwo fps ranged from 130 to 90 with an average of around 100 fps in my experience 130 is where this game tops out considering how poorly optimized this game is 100 to 130 is perfect better yet i was able to maintain this performance connected to my external 34 1440 monitor next diablo iv this game runs great at medium high settings with dlss turned on dlss is fine when walking around a town when bossing or in a tough fight where timing is everything then dlss simply gets in the way and in some cases will get your character killed with dlss on i was steady around 130 fps with dlss off the g18 was able to maintain a steady 100 or higher fps graphics settings were set to medium high with some ray tracing on finally call of duty black ops 6 the first thing i did was run the built in benchmark calibration routine i posted a screenshot so you can see all the numbers the system scored 150 with dlss on and 136 with dlss off for competitive play turn dlss off it will save you a lot of frustration actual game play the fps hovered around 100 fps this was more than good enough to remain competitive there was not screen tearing no lag and not ghosting on the screen i actually had some of my best matches on the g18 that is after i turned off dlss with dlss on i had some of my worst matches due to the lag or delay in real time screen rendered information overall less dlss my gaming experience was excellent dlss has its place just not in online competitive gaming fan noise the g18 has five power profile modes that directly impact system noise amory crate has three pre configured profiles silent performance and turbo amory crate also has a mode that works directly with windows power plan finally there is the option to build your own power profile silent is exactly that fans are off the system will get warm but not hot performance mode has a range from quiet to loud depending on system load energy consumption increases on the system this in turn causes more heat which demands the fans run to keep the system cool while gaming the fans ramped up to about 80 to 90 i would recommend a good pair of noise canceling headphones while gaming turbo mode is full peak system power peak heat and peak leaf blower fan performance at 100 the g18 fans are loud headphones with good noise isolation is required the fans running at 100 does a good job of keeping up with the heat but the system will still heat up and you will run into cpu throttling overall i feel that the performance pre set power profile is an excellent balance between energy consumption heat management and performance keyboard and rgb lighting the keyboard is well laid out comfortable to type and game on and the keys have a good resistance and return the only thing i do not like about this keyboard are the translucent q w e r a s d f and space bar keys in a dark room or a room with poor lighting it is nearly impossible to read the silk screened letter on the key cap i found this challenging in situations where i need to see the key for example i use a rare key function in one of my games and want to visually confirm before pressing the key not all my games are fps games this is not an issue in a well lit room the rgb as a whole is very well done the letters number and words on the regular key caps are shine through and each key cap allows light to purposely blead around the edges the bottom of the g18 has four rgb light strips that can either coordinate with the keyboard rgb or act independent of the keyboard i kept them on for a few days and then turned them off the rgb strips are well done well placed and cast a lot of light asus provides a way to change rgb via some presets it also provides the ability to turn the lighting off one place where asus seems to keep missing the mark is keyboard lighting customization aura creator is a nice to have assuming it will even detect your keyboard and chassis light bars but it is insanely difficult to use to any effect and tying custom profiles to games has always been a hit or miss exercise sound the speakers are clear and good enough for laptop speakers they won t compete with a dedicated headset or dedicated external speakers they are good enough for youtube pod casts netflix internet radio and other leisurely listening activities while gaming the fan noise will overwhelm the speaker audio quality they are still useful for gaming however the competition with the fan noise will eventually force you into a headset screen performance i think asus nailed it with the screen colors are bright and vibrant the refresh rate at 240hz is excellent i did not notice any ghosting artifacts or screen tearing while gaming even the fast twitch movements associated with playing cod6 was clean fast and completely immersive the only thing that would make my experience better is upgrading the laptop s screen to an oled or connecting to an external oled gaming monitor upgradability i upgrade my laptops back in the day laptops had doors and drawers to access hard drives memory cd players and batteries today everything has screws and plastic clamps which are time consuming difficult to work with and can often lead to scratches or other unintended damage thank you thank you thank you asus for bringing easy back to user accessible upgrades the bottom cover has a latch that slides clicks and then the bottom cover simply slides off it could not be any easier ram battery and ssd slots are easily accessible the main board is protected by a secondary plastic cover final thoughts this is a beast of a system the system will get warm regardless of what power mode is selected under load the system fans get loud gaming performance is excellent daily productivity is excellent there are power saving features such as cpu core configuration and nvidia optimus that will help make this laptop perfect as a workstation and gaming computer replacement overall i am very happy with the g18 i think it is an excellent

5,The Best of the Best!!,"Usually whenever you think about upgrading your PC you always want the best of the best.  “I wish my new computer could be the ultimate gaming machine with the best graphics card a big, beautiful screen, a high-end processor that will handle anything I throw at it and oh, it wouldn’t hurt if it was easy to upgrade too.”  Well luckily for you the new ASUS ROG Strix G18 is the exact computer you’re looking for, and no this is not an Obi Wan Kenobi mind trick.
Initial unboxing of an ROG product is always an enjoyable experience and the G18 is no exception.  The theme of the box has the feel of a high-performance car and upon opening you’re greeted with a stencil highlighting some of the aspects of the design of the laptop.  Holding the laptop for the first time it’s evident this model isn’t made to be super portable clocking in at 7.5 pounds.  But nonetheless it’s a beautiful piece of machinery.  Booting it up for the first time and seeing the RGB lights shimmer rainbow colors on my glass desk was an awesome experience.  Whoever thought of putting a light bar around the bottom of the laptop should get a raise.  Really cool feature that I never knew I needed!    The keyboard immediately stands out as well.  You’re either going to love it or hate it, but the Q,W,E,R,A,S,D,F and Space bar are all translucent style keys that are affected more by the Aura gaming lighting than the other keys.  The keyboard is full-sized with keys that feel soft but responsive. There are additional hot keys for gaming as well.  You can’t help but notice how big, bright (500 nits) and beautiful the screen is on this laptop.  I’ve owned a lot of different gaming laptops, and this is the nicest I’ve probably ever seen.
ASUS has spared no expense with this computer, throwing the literal gambit of high-end parts that any gamer would be looking for.  The Ultra 9 275HX is an absolute beast of a processor.

It should also be noted this laptop has a super cool way of upgrading the ram and HD’s with a latch system underneath that allows easy access in seconds!  The cooling on this laptop is another standout feature with the ROG intelligent cooling.  Their designs allow the laptop to run cooler and quieter and it’s noticeable when pushing the laptop during gaming.  It’s probably one of the quietest high-performance laptops I’ve ever tested.  The laptop comes with a slew of different ports; 2 Thunderbolt 5 USB-C, 3 USB-A, HDMI 2.1 a 2.5g ethernet port or WIFI 7 to choose from.  The speakers on the laptop are impressive with a Dolby Atmos quad speaker setup.  I’ve been playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 nonstop and the music sounds gorgeous.  The laptop comes with Windows 11 Home and utilizes Copilot which is something I’ve grown to use quite a bit.  Xbox game pass is the best deal in town and gets you access to so many great games and luckily the computer comes with a 3 month trial to test it out!
After putting this computer through the ringer and playing countless hours of gaming, I could be happier with the results.

5,Monster specs and monster game play,"Gaming machines come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and whether you prefer a stationary desktop setup, or a more portable approach that you can bring to a friends house, they all come down to the same individual pieces that collectively, determine the strength of your game system.  Unfortunately there is a huge trade off between quality and affordability that generally determines what system you'll ultimately be playing on.  The ASUS ROG Strix line can be configured with a variety of options that can lower or raise the price and performance.  My review is based on this machine model as it is sold by ASUS.

The ASUS ROG Strix G18 is without question a machine on the quality side of that equation.  But if you're a serious gamer who loves the portability aspect of gaming machines (or you happen to not care how much money a great machine costs), this is definitely one to consider.  I find that most gaming PCs do, at some point, start pulling their punches when it comes to putting together a consumer rig.  Usually skimping on things like the amount of memory, the quality of the display and graphics card and even the CPU.  For those who don't know, and may find the machine name confusing, ROG is what ASUS refers to as Republic of Gamers.  These is a high quality gaming machine line.  The Strix refers to a type of owl, and its qualities, which is why the logo is an owl's eye.

Build, look and feel
ASUS has packed a ton of great features into this machine and they have done so from the ground, up.  The entire build is based on a solid frame and even though some might whine that it's not made of solid titanium, the look and feel is a beautiful dark gray color that doesn't seem to show a lot of fingerprints.  The deck slopes towards you slightly and all the corners are gracefully rounded.  All the exhaust venting, points out the back, which is really a big plus to me.  I have several other laptops that vent out the right side (right where you hand naturally works the mouse), which is insanely annoying.  Venting out the back keeps all the hot air (which is considerable thanks to the great cooling system that's been implemented) away from the user.  The entire rear edge is used as exhaust and has a really cool “grill” type look to it.  Overall, it's a sleek and pleasantly minimalist design.  The display hinges are unique and solid offering the right amount of resistance.  This is a machine that tops out at just over 7 lbs., so it has a very solid feel to it.  Generally, people always seem to balk at a heavier laptop but they don't seem to realize that a lighter machine is going to have more of a flimsy feel and less internal support.

If you ever wanted to max out the RAM on your laptop or add more drive space, you will totally appreciate this machine when you flip it over.  Releasing a small latch at the front and pulling forward on the bottom panel, allows the entire panel to be removed, giving you a view of the internals of the machine.  Now you have direct access to the RAM, but that's not all.  There are also two M.2 slots as well that are directly accessed (one is filled with the 2TB drive, but the other is empty).  It appears that the battery may also be accessible.   I didn't try to remove it, but it looks like that would be possible.  The bottom panel is as easy to put back on as it is to remove.  This is a really nice feature, and will be appreciated by anyone who has ever tried to update their laptop and been frustrated by the lack of access they usually have.

Features
Anyone looking for a high end gaming laptop is able to look up the long list of features and specs for themselves, so I don't want to waste a lot of time here (I mean the list literally goes on and on), but I need to at least highlight what I consider to be the stand out components.  All these components combine to eek out as much speed and performance as possible.

Intel Core Ultra 9 processor
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 graphics processor
32GB of DDR5 memory
2TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 SSD
3 individual processors (Intel Ultra 9, NVIDIA 5080 and Intel NPU for AI)
18” IPS, LED display, 240Hz, 2560 x 1600 resolution monitor with anti glare screen
Fantastic cooling and heat exhaust system

I could certainly go on, but you should, by now have the impression that this is a machine that will handle (with ease) any current game you care to throw at it.  If I could sum it up, it's fast, smooth and insanely competent.  Playing Doom Eternal is just a pleasure.  This is the first machine I've played that game on where the machine speed can actually go much faster than the user can.  This is not to say other machines can't handle the game properly, it just seems that this machine has horsepower to spare and will go as fast as you could possibly need it to.

Keyboard and lighting effects
The keyboard is laid out well, with the inclusion of a full set of number keys along with the standard dual use function keys.  There is also a great set of five keys dedicated to volume up and down, microphone off/on, fan mode (which allows you to cycle through different fan speeds on the fly), and a key to directly open up the Armoury Crate program.  While these five keys have specific icons on them, you can configure them for different options if the standard ones aren't to your liking.  There's also a dedicated and easily identified power button, along with an absolutely huge touch pad.  I like the feel of the low profile keys.  They seem to have a higher resistant action that feels very solid and not mushy.  One thing I do wish this very full size keyboard had was more definition and isolation of the arrow keys.  It seems they could of done a little better here by making them more obvious.  As they are, there is a generous amount of space between the Copilot key and the left arrow key, but the rest of the arrows just flow into the keys next to them without an easy way to feel any definition.  Not a big deal, but something that I personally miss.

The lighting and effects controls are all customized through the Armoury Crate and Aura Creator programs.  Basic lighting controls can be handled through Armouuy Crate (along with other system settings).  Aura Creator will allow you to set to different color and effect profiles.  This is where you can change the way you would like the the ground effects lighting (Full-Surround AURA) and key zone lighting to look and act.  There are four key zones that divide up the keyboard, but unfortunately, this particular model does not allow for per-key assignments.  While the dedicated look of the standard gaming keys is nice, I feel that if you want to be able to actually read the keys, it helps to use a darker color as the print on the keys is white.   With the huge color palette and effects offerings, this will certainly afford you hours of customization fun.  Also, you can save different profiles 'til your heart's content.  Usually, in my experience, the selection of color choices seems to be far greater than what the actual LEDs can reproduce, and that is still the case here, but anyone familiar with this type of customization will probably expect that.

Display and audio
The display is a 2.5K, 16:10 size with a 240Hz refresh rate.  It includes features like Dolby Vision (on video playback), Pantone color validation (which is a way of keeping colors true to the Pantone color palette), it's able to use NVIDIA G-SYNC on games, inherently uses blue light filtering and has a matte finish that shows rich and deep colors from any angle without an annoying room reflection.  In short, it's a beautiful display experience.  The built in sound on this laptop is better than I've heard on most others.  It includes virtual Dolby Atmos (5.1.2), from two speakers somehow.  I don't know how they do it but I did hear a noticeable difference in the sound quality, over many (if not all) other laptops I've played on.  I can only describe the sound as extremely spatial.  Sound seems to come from more places than just the speakers.

Conclusion
Anyone that has a desire to buy a high end gaming laptop with specs out the ceiling, should at least give this machine some consideration.  It's components are really outstanding and without question allow you to play any game you want.  This will certainly be a good fit for content creators, and photo/video creation and editing.  People looking for this quality will have no trouble spending what it takes to get that feature set, and I will say the cost is not for the faint of heart.  I like everything about this machine and appreciate all the small touches it includes like the beefy, dedicated power supply (with the owl eye logo as well), but if you don't want to take the supply with you, you can also charge it with a USB-C input.  The light colors and effects are great, especially the unique ground effects lighting.  The overall look and feel with the curved corners and dark gray finish.  The way the keyboard stays nice and cool even though the exhaust is blasting out scalding hot air from intense gaming (truly, this is a really spectacular and underrated achievement).  RJ-45 network connection, which in itself is an average inclusion, but this is a 2.5GbE port, so good job there.  Any true gamer will thoroughly appreciate the specs, the layout and the fun this machine brings to the table.

This is where you can change the way you would like the the ground effects lighting (Full-Surround AURA) and key zone lighting to look and act.  There are four key zones that divide up the keyboard, but unfortunately, this particular model does not allow for per-key assignments.  While the dedicated look of the standard gaming keys is nice, I feel that if you want to be able to actually read the keys, it helps to use a darker color as the print on the keys is white.   With the huge color palette and effects offerings, this will certainly afford you hours of customization fun.  Also, you can save different profiles 'til your heart's content.  Usually, in my experience, the selection of color choices seems to be far greater than what the actual LEDs can reproduce, and that is still the case here, but anyone familiar with this type of customization will probably expect that.

Display and audio
The display is a 2.5K, 16:10 size with a 240Hz refresh rate.  It includes features like Dolby Vision (on video playback), Pantone color validation (which is a way of keeping colors true to the Pantone color palette), it's able to use NVIDIA G-SYNC on games, inherently uses blue light filtering and has a matte finish that shows rich and deep colors from any angle without an annoying room reflection.  In short, it's a beautiful display experience.  The built in sound on this laptop is better than I've heard on most others.  It includes virtual Dolby Atmos (5.1.2), from two speakers somehow.  I don't know how they do it but I did hear a noticeable difference in the sound quality, over many (if not all) other laptops I've played on.  I can only describe the sound as extremely spatial.  Sound seems to come from more places than just the speakers.

Conclusion
Anyone that has a desire to buy a high end gaming laptop with specs out the ceiling, should at least give this machine some consideration.  It's components are really outstanding and without question allow you to play any game you want.  This will certainly be a good fit for content creators, and photo/video creation and editing.  People looking for this quality will have no trouble spending what it takes to get that feature set, and I will say the cost is not for the faint of heart.  I like everything about this machine and appreciate all the small touches it includes like the beefy, dedicated power supply (with the owl eye logo as well), but if you don't want to take the supply with you, you can also charge it with a USB-C input.  The light colors and effects are great, especially the unique ground effects lighting.  The overall look and feel with the curved corners and dark gray finish.  The way the keyboard stays nice and cool even though the exhaust is blasting out scalding hot air from intense gaming (truly, this is a really spectacular and underrated achievement).  RJ-45 network connection, which in itself is an average inclusion, but this is a 2.5GbE port, so good job there.  Any true gamer will thoroughly appreciate the specs, the layout and the fun this machine brings to the table.  Exceptional job ASUS!",gaming machines come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and whether you prefer a stationary desktop setup or a more portable approach that you can bring to a friends house they all come down to the same individual pieces that collectively determine the strength of your game system unfortunately there is a huge trade off between quality and affordability that generally determines what system you ll ultimately be playing on the asus rog strix line can be configured with a variety of options that can lower or raise the price and performance my review is based on this machine model as it is sold by asus the asus rog strix g18 is without question a machine on the quality side of that equation but if you re a serious gamer who loves the portability aspect of gaming machines or you happen to not care how much money a great machine costs this is definitely one to consider i find that most gaming pcs do at some point start pulling their punches when it comes to putting together a consumer rig usually skimping on things like the amount of memory the quality of the display and graphics card and even the cpu for those who don t know and may find the machine name confusing rog is what asus refers to as republic of gamers these is a high quality gaming machine line the strix refers to a type of owl and its qualities which is why the logo is an owl s eye build look and feel asus has packed a ton of great features into this machine and they have done so from the ground up the entire build is based on a solid frame and even though some might whine that it s not made of solid titanium the look and feel is a beautiful dark gray color that doesn t seem to show a lot of fingerprints the deck slopes towards you slightly and all the corners are gracefully rounded all the exhaust venting points out the back which is really a big plus to me i have several other laptops that vent out the right side right where you hand naturally works the mouse which is insanely annoying venting out the back keeps all the hot air which is considerable thanks to the great cooling system that s been implemented away from the user the entire rear edge is used as exhaust and has a really cool grill type look to it overall it s a sleek and pleasantly minimalist design the display hinges are unique and solid offering the right amount of resistance this is a machine that tops out at just over 7 lbs so it has a very solid feel to it generally people always seem to balk at a heavier laptop but they don t seem to realize that a lighter machine is going to have more of a flimsy feel and less internal support if you ever wanted to max out the ram on your laptop or add more drive space you will totally appreciate this machine when you flip it over releasing a small latch at the front and pulling forward on the bottom panel allows the entire panel to be removed giving you a view of the internals of the machine now you have direct access to the ram but that s not all there are also two m 2 slots as well that are directly accessed one is filled with the 2tb drive but the other is empty it appears that the battery may also be accessible i didn t try to remove it but it looks like that would be possible the bottom panel is as easy to put back on as it is to remove this is a really nice feature and will be appreciated by anyone who has ever tried to update their laptop and been frustrated by the lack of access they usually have features anyone looking for a high end gaming laptop is able to look up the long list of features and specs for themselves so i don t want to waste a lot of time here i mean the list literally goes on and on but i need to at least highlight what i consider to be the stand out components all these components combine to eek out as much speed and performance as possible intel core ultra 9 processor nvidia geforce rtx 5080 graphics processor 32gb of ddr5 memory 2tb m 2 pcie 4 0 ssd 3 individual processors intel ultra 9 nvidia 5080 and intel npu for ai 18 ips led display 240hz 2560 x 1600 resolution monitor with anti glare screen fantastic cooling and heat exhaust system i could certainly go on but you should by now have the impression that this is a machine that will handle with ease any current game you care to throw at it if i could sum it up it s fast smooth and insanely competent playing doom eternal is just a pleasure this is the first machine i ve played that game on where the machine speed can actually go much faster than the user can this is not to say other machines can t handle the game properly it just seems that this machine has horsepower to spare and will go as fast as you could possibly need it to keyboard and lighting effects the keyboard is laid out well with the inclusion of a full set of number keys along with the standard dual use function keys there is also a great set of five keys dedicated to volume up and down microphone off on fan mode which allows you to cycle through different fan speeds on the fly and a key to directly open up the armoury crate program while these five keys have specific icons on them you can configure them for different options if the standard ones aren t to your liking there s also a dedicated and easily identified power button along with an absolutely huge touch pad i like the feel of the low profile keys they seem to have a higher resistant action that feels very solid and not mushy one thing i do wish this very full size keyboard had was more definition and isolation of the arrow keys it seems they could of done a little better here by making them more obvious as they are there is a generous amount of space between the copilot key and the left arrow key but the rest of the arrows just flow into the keys next to them without an easy way to feel any definition not a big deal but something that i personally miss the lighting and effects controls are all customized through the armoury crate and aura creator programs basic lighting controls can be handled through armouuy crate along with other system settings aura creator will allow you to set to different color and effect profiles this is where you can change the way you would like the the ground effects lighting full surround aura and key zone lighting to look and act there are four key zones that divide up the keyboard but unfortunately this particular model

5,Closest thing to a full-sized rig that I've owned!,"Ever since I have stopped buying/building full tower gaming rigs, I have gravitated towards those gaming laptops that are a bit sleeker and portable, like the ASUS ROG Zephyrus (which is a fabulous computer in its own right), but this time I wondered if I was doing it all wrong and should have instead been looking at laptops like the Strix.  Well, I can safely say that after a week of playing, and testing, and playing some more on the ROG Strix G18, that I WAS wrong and should have been looking here all along.

I'm not going to get all bogged down in specs, temperatures, and FPS numbers.  There are reviewers out there (and probably here on Best Buy), that do a far more comprehensive job than I ever could.  What I will say, is that the G18 is the closest to a full-sized and loaded gaming rig that I've ever owned in a laptop format.  BTW, I'm old and have been PC gaming since the Commodore 64!  Heck, I remember when my first custom built tower came from Micron computers back in the *cough* 90's, and the awesome new monitor was a 17"" CRT beast!

The thing I like the most out of the ASUS ROG Strix G18, is that I don't feel like I'm giving up too much for the portability.  Now part of that is because the G18 is NOT as portable as any laptop I've owned before.  I remember days of hauling my tower and monitor to a friend's house to set up big gaming LAN parties, and for some reason I've always had in my head that a gaming laptop HAS to be ultimately portable, but that has almost always come at a cost of playability.  Plus, as an older gamer, I also don't tend to travel with my gaming gear as much, so I was prioritizing the wrong thing.  Hence, the G18 is a great device that I can keep on my shelf and pull out whenever I get the itch to play but not take up a ton of space.

I really dig what ASUS has done with their laptop packaging, software, and upgradability with the G18.  Opening up the box, you are served up the G18 like the prized possession it is about to be and getting it up and running was the easiest thing I've EVER done with a gaming PC.  I started cutting open the box at 0645 on the day after it arrived and I was waking up in the dungeon of Cyrodiil in 'Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion' at 0831.  And that is with doing ALL of the updating, from the software, to the BIOS, to cleaning up what very little junk ASUS puts on their systems, to downloading and installing the game from Game Pass Ultimate.  The longest part was downloading the game.  Easiest time ever with a gaming computer.

Also, if you like to tinker a bit with your computers but are no longer in the mood for entire builds or re-builds, the Strix is really nice too.  I wanted to add some additional storage space, and it was the easiest thing ever.  Flip the laptop over, slide the lever to the left, slide the bottom case toward you, lift up, slot in the SSD, turn the locking knob, and slide the case back on until it locks.  Done.  Peak efficiency.  While it was open I could see that it would be relatively easy for me to tinker with other things if I ever get the itch, but I don't see that happening any time soon.  And that's because this thing is a gaming BEAST.

I ran Oblivion at the best settings (not max mind you), and the game played like a champ, always staying right around the 60fps target.  And it looked beautiful on this screen.  I personally believe that the 2/2.5K resolution is the best for gaming.  You get beauty without it killing your system.  And like I said, the Strix handled it like a pro because one of the other benefits of going with a larger system like this is the better air flow.  Even when the Strix was running it's hardest, the fan never got to 'jet engine' levels like I would get with her more svelte cousins.

There has only been one little 'meh' thing for me and that hasn't been all that bad, and that is the sound.  I was expecting the Strix to be able to push out some bigger and bolder sound, but I didn't find that to be the case.  While the sound is perfectly useable, and you even get some decent separation in right and left channels because of its size, it will not on its own blow you away.  That's OK, because I tend to play with headphones anyway, and the Strix drives those just fine.

All-in-all I'm super stoked with the G18.  I found that I have been looking in the wrong place all along for the best combo of capability, size, and portability.  It's the first time that I feel that I haven't really given up anything with a laptop over a tower.

5,"The Latest & Greatest packed neatly in an 18"" box","Over time I've had a number of gaming laptops; most recently a previous model of this ROG, and an Alienware M5. To date, each of these have had some performance or design details that were either not included or resulted in poor performance. I've been a reader to the Asus forum many times, and when I had a problem or complaint, I could always count on others with the same concern. So, I'd have to say that in designing this model, Asus has read, studied, and addressed a number of issues that the ROG gamers had presented; the result being this ROG Strix G18. 
I have to first comment on the presentation - it comes in a unique box that upon lifting the lid, the laptop itself rises up and presents itself to you. I'm surprised they didn't include a voice chip like you'd get in a greeting card that announces itself with a flourish of trumpets - TA-DA! Nice touch, but what else you got!?
The machine itself has a nicely sculpted lid with a crisp, clean design. Lid is a little heavy to open, but the dual hinges are solid and swing smoothly. The thin edge bezel also has a solid feel, I've had bezels that actually bend under the stress of opening, not so here. But far & away, the feature I most appreciate is the ""no tool"" back cover. There's a small slider on the underside, slide it open, push the lid up a notch, and the cover is off, revealing all the internals. No need to deal with a half dozen or more tiny screws, you can get your vacuum working in there in less than ten seconds. All the fans (3 of them) are exposed and easily cleaned. I used to dread doing this job on my Alienware, took the better part of an hour or more. This will surely be the cleanest laptop I've ever owned. Thanks, Asus. 
Can't say I play a variety of games, but do have one I've committed thousands of hours to - the Civilization series - I've owned every one from the beginning, but since Civ 6, and now 7, you can reaglly ratchet up the performance sliders to place high demands on the processing & video power. I would set the framerate & other video specs to half peak values, and that machine would sound like it had emphysema with the fans pouring out heat into the room. This would be my performance test for the G18. I could finally turn the detail sliders up to their max, and enjoy gameplay as the creators intended. The color palette of the screen is gorgeous, I could zoom in to hotspots and enjoy the detail the game artists created. 
There is one detail I'd like to nitpick with the Asus designers, as I see they are scanning the reviews here. The keyboard lighting. If you're working in the dark, it's pretty near impossible to see the special characters (when shift key is used) - only the numbers light; not the characters above them. Yes, it's a gaming pc, but I do work with it, emailing, etc., and since I'm not a professional typist, I have to use a flashlight to find my ampersands and hashtags. 
One other reason that draws me to Asus is their online support forum - I've owned Asus products for over 20 years, I would think that the ROG gamer participation is probably one of the beat in the industry. That, and the included Armoury Crate software which offers a myriad of customization & performance settings to improve your experience.

These guys are serious about gaming.",over time i ve had a number of gaming laptops most recently a previous model of this rog and an alienware m5 to date each of these have had some performance or design details that were either not included or resulted in poor performance i ve been a reader to the asus forum many times and when i had a problem or complaint i could always count on others with the same concern so i d have to say that in designing this model asus has read studied and addressed a number of issues that the rog gamers had presented the result being this rog strix g18 i have to first comment on the presentation it comes in a unique box that upon lifting the lid the laptop itself rises up and presents itself to you i m surprised they didn t include a voice chip like you d get in a greeting card that announces itself with a flourish of trumpets ta da nice touch but what else you got the machine itself has a nicely sculpted lid with a crisp clean design lid is a little heavy to open but the dual hinges are solid and swing smoothly the thin edge bezel also has a solid feel i ve had bezels that actually bend under the stress of opening not so here but far away the feature i most appreciate is the no tool back cover there s a small slider on the underside slide it open push the lid up a notch and the cover is off revealing all the internals no need to deal with a half dozen or more tiny screws you can get your vacuum working in there in less than ten seconds all the fans 3 of them are exposed and easily cleaned i used to dread doing this job on my alienware took the better part of an hour or more this will surely be the cleanest laptop i ve ever owned thanks asus can t say i play a variety of games but do have one i ve committed thousands of hours to the civilization series i ve owned every one from the beginning but since civ 6 and now 7 you can reaglly ratchet up the performance sliders to place high demands on the processing video power i would set the framerate other video specs to half peak values and that machine would sound like it had emphysema with the fans pouring out heat into the room this would be my performance test for the g18 i could finally turn the detail sliders up to their max and enjoy gameplay as the creators intended the color palette of the screen is gorgeous i could zoom in to hotspots and enjoy the detail the game artists created there is one detail i d like to nitpick with the asus designers as i see they are scanning the reviews here the keyboard lighting if you re working in the dark it s pretty near impossible to see the special characters when shift key is used only the numbers light not the characters above them yes it s a gaming pc but i do work with it emailing etc and since i m not a professional typist i have to use a flashlight to find my ampersands and hashtags one other reason that draws me to asus is their online support forum i ve owned asus products for over 20 years i would think that the rog gamer participation is probably one of the beat in the industry that and the included armoury crate software which offers a myriad of customization performance settings to improve your experience these guys are serious about gaming,5,1.0,POSITIVE,0.9663495421409607,0.9663495421409607,0.9831747710704803,0.9831747710704803,1,1,1
5,AMAZING LAPTOP. DESIGN/PERFORMANCE- 5080 BEAST!,"I was blown away by this gaming laptop, the design, size and performance is amazing- exceeds all expectations. It has numerous features and ease of access to upgrade RAM/SSD make this a must have gaming PC. I will focus on the gaming aspect as that is it's designed purpose.

FIRST OFF, It looks amazing- the screen size 18"" 2.5K 240Hz Nebula Display looks amazing. The brightness, refresh rate and color pops- the graphics look great while gaming or watching movies- the other use I have for it. The refresh rate is pretty standard in gaming laptops, no blur, smooth motion without any lag.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU- Beast of a video card- the Nvidia App also lets you run auto-tune for better performance. The Design of the laptop allows for the air circulation to come in thru the underneath and exhaust all the hot air thru the rear of the laptop. The fan does get a little noisy  but when i am gaming the volume is up or i have head phones on so it not an issue for me.

It has blazing 32GB DDR5, the 2 slots are used so you can't add memory without replacing the installed sticks. It does have spare SSD slot if you want to add storage, I am adding a SSD for dedicated gaming drive. The bottom panel has a manual switch/lever which allows you to remove the panel without tools. The SSD can be removed with a manual Q-Latch, no tools needed.  It is a very nice and simple design.

The Keyboard has a very satisfying feel, the travel and click makes for a very responsive and spaced out keys. You don't feel like the keys are jammed together. The trackpad, is a decent size , i don't use it much but it looks good. The aura RGB is nice, bright and adjustable...I am not huge fan so I turn it off. 

The speakers are very loud, it was surprising how nice the bass sounds and how clear the sound it at the upper volume levels.

The IR camera is a nice bonus because it allows for Microsoft Hello login feature, makes it pretty seamless to just boot up the pc and have bypass the lockscreen. 

I downloaded Battlefield 2042 and Skyrim, i have an xbox style controller connected via bluetooth and the screensize, color quality, refresh rate and GPU make this a top tier gaming PC. 
Battlefield -OPTIMIZED Settings gave me an average of 122fps, and the GPU temp hovered at about 72 degrees...the fan was pretty much going non-stop and it was fairly loud but like i mentioned earlier I play my games with the sound pretty high.

The performance of the has left nothing to be desired, so far no complaints but there are some things to aware of...the power adapter is a brick, it's heavy and big. The laptop itself is very heavy and not really meant for use on the go..as in using it on a plane/uber...its pretty big but well worth it.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"I was blown away by this gaming laptop, the design, size and performance is amazing- exceeds all expectations.

5,Perfect replacement for gaming desktop,"The ASUS ROG Strix is a very functional gaming and multi-use laptop, though at this size, it's really to replace my desktop.
I picked the 18 inch version because to fully enjoy gaming, any smaller screen may be too small (unless you value portability more).

The screen is beautifully bright and sharp. I really liked that the keyboard's QWERT and ASDF keys are transparent, along with the space bar.
The LED lights are a nice ambiance touch and give the feel the laptop is almost floating. You can edit the lighting with the AURA function (F4).
It comes with Armoury Crate installed, which enables you to customize cool aura and breathing wallpapers that are synchronized with the laptop's LED lighting.

There are two USB A ports on the right and 3 ports on the left (1 USB-A and 2 USB-C). This seems well designed to me because for gaming, you'd want to connect the mouse on the right side and not have a wired mess interfering with it.

The trackpad is quite enormous, and I had to disable it for gaming with a mouse because my left hand (lower thumb area) kept accidentally clicking it.

While there is plenty of keyboard real estate, the number pad on the right is a bit crammed, as the ""right/end"" key sits just below the #1 key.
The numbered keys on the right are also smaller adding to that squeezed in look. That said, I do appreciate them being there for numerical functions.
The keys are quiet and not as flat as a normal laptop. They have enough height to where it feels comfortable switching from a mechanical keyboard.

The build quality is fine. It's not amazing or terrible, it does the job. The focus here is the GEFORCE RTX 5080 and the large screen anyway, so the build quality isn't an issue to me.

Performance-wise, the laptop does well. You can expect the fan to run quite loud when the NVIDIA settings auto select the optimal graphics for your game.
When you exit the game, the laptop is quiet as a mouse. The F5 function will also let you quickly select the fan mode (turbo, silent, performance).

I was able to run Fornite on maxed out settings with no issue.
All the heat blows out the back, and the laptop seems to be efficient at moving air to stay cool.

All in all, I'm very satisfied with this laptop as a PC replacement.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"The ASUS ROG Strix is a very functional gaming and multi-use laptop, though at this size, it's really to replace my desktop.

5,"Fantastic Performance, Excellent Thermals!","The ROG strikes G 18 2025, 5080 is it extremely well built gaming machine. The RGB lights at the bottom of the laptop are a very cool feature that I did not know I needed. I’m used to seeing RGB on laptops, but having it go fully around the laptop adds a ton more flare and it looks amazing. Stellar feature. The lid is metal and well built.Everything else is plastic, which isn’t a problem for me. It does have an HDMI 2.1 port that is connected to the dedicated GPU, which is nice. As for airflow, which was nice to see that they adjusted this, the vent ventilation is on the back as opposed to the sides so you don’t get your hand burned while gaming.

Gaming wise, whatever I was playing, I was about to stay well above 80 fps on average. Temps stayed cool from what I can see and never did I the keyboard feel to hot to use (which is a huge plus for longer sessions). I really cool feature I loved was the toolless back removal. While it seems simple, I do not dread removing the back like I have with other machines that require tools and for you too keep with the very small screws. Huge plus.

5,One Month Honest Review,"Please read this before buying. No proper reviews are out yet, not even on YouTube, so I’m sharing everything I found, including two big issues that many older models had: backlight bleeding and improper liquid metal application.

1. Display – Backlight Bleed? Nope.
Some people said this laptop has backlight bleeding issues, but mine didn’t have any. In fact, none of my friends who bought the same laptop had this issue either.
The screen is honestly majestic – it’s huge, super smooth, and bright. No complaints at all.

2. Fan Noise & Thermals – Not Bad at All
In Performance mode, fans do get a bit loud, but if you wear headphones, you won’t even notice. Turbo mode makes it louder, but I personally didn’t see any major FPS gains from it, so I just stick to Performance mode.

Surprisingly, the laptop doesn’t heat up much, even after long gaming sessions. I’d recommend tilting it slightly using the power brick or a stand to help with airflow underneath.

3. Keyboard & Trackpad – Smooth Experience
Trackpad is massive – feels great to use.

Keyboard’s solid – no flex, no rattles, just smooth and responsive typing/gaming.

4. Battery – Don’t Expect Much
If you’re planning to game on battery… don’t.
I got around 1 to 1.5 hours max while gaming. This laptop is built to be used while plugged in, simple as that.

5. Gaming Performance – Rock Solid
Every game I tested gave minimum 60-80 FPS on Silent Mode (with Very High to Ultra settings, plus ray tracing and path tracing with dlss set to quality).
With Performance Mode, I was getting around 120-130 FPS on the same settings.
And yes, I played on native resolution, which is 2.5k.

Games I tested:
Cyberpunk 2077

Elden Ring

God of War (2018)

Sekiro

Red Dead Redemption 2

Expedition 33

Spider-Man Remastered (2022)

I mostly use Silent Mode, which gives me super quiet gameplay and smooth 70 FPS. Honestly, that's more than enough for me.
6. GPU Issues? Initially, Yes – But Now Fixed
When I first got the laptop, I faced:
Screen flickering
Black screen after sleep
Laptop not waking up properly after heavy gaming

After updating all the drivers (especially the GPU ones), everything works perfectly now.
Also, Intel GPU drivers aren’t installed from factory, so make sure you download those manually if you want to switch to iGPU when using battery.

7. Hinges – Tight & Solid
The hinge feels very sturdy. No wobble or looseness. Feels premium and long-lasting.

8. Liquid Metal Application – No Issues for Me
One major issue people mentioned with older models was bad liquid metal application, but my unit seems fine.

How to check?
Run Cinebench R23 and see your CPU score.
I ran it on Turbo mode (default settings), and got 35,900.
As long as you're getting between 35,000 to 36,000, your liquid metal is probably applied correctly.

9. RGB & Looks – Chef’s Kiss
The RGB is just beautiful. Especially the underglow around the bottom chassis – looks insane in low light. Feels like a proper ROG beast.

10. Misc
Some people recommend undervolting it. But I’m on stock settings and haven’t felt the need. So it's up to you.

5,"Big, Beastly, Powerhouse","Gaming has come a long way.  In fact, this laptop has better specs than what most desktops would consider top tier only a mere few years ago.  I have been using this laptop for a few weeks not and have had nothing but positive experiences.  This gaming laptop offers (nearly) every bell and whistle you'd ever want on a laptop.  There are countless reasons on why I enjoy this set up but below are my top reasons.  

Storage - This latop comes with a wopping 2 TB of storage via SSD.  As games require more and more storage, ASUS is stepping up their end of the bargain too by offering storage in TB vs GBs.  This will give ever gamer plenty of lead way to jam out to their 100 GB + fav game that is on their radar.

Speed - With 32 GB of memory and a GeForce RTX 5080, this rig will tear through and need you may have.  Again, as mentioned above I recall having 8 GB  in an older pc which was upgraded from 4GB.  The 32 stock GB of ram will satisfy ever top setting modes for most games out there, and when paired with the 5080... an immersive experience awaits.  

Design - This laptop is big, heavy but built very sound.  Its 18 inch screen towers over most laptops and its LED screen will make any game or movie pop.  Its colors are bright and its blur it minimal to none.  This laptop will light up any room with its screen.  Its weight is said to be about 7.5 lbs which is the polar opposite of other laptops, but with more computing comes more weight.  The outputs provided are exactly what you are looking for too with several thunderbold to usb to hdmi to usb c ports to feed your needs.

5,Excellent Gaming Laptop – Worth Every Dollar,"I’ve been using this gaming laptop for a little while now, and I’m honestly impressed with how well it performs. The build quality feels premium, the keyboard is super comfortable for long gaming sessions, and the RGB lighting gives it that clean, gaming-aesthetic without feeling over the top.

Performance-wise, this thing doesn’t miss. Games run incredibly smooth, even on high settings, and the cooling system actually keeps temps under control better than I expected for a laptop. I can play AAA titles with no lag or stutter, and it handles multitasking like a champ — gaming, streaming, Discord, and music all at once with zero issues.

The display is bright, crisp, and the high refresh rate makes a huge difference in shooters and fast-paced games. The speakers are surprisingly solid too, but it truly shines with a headset.

Battery life is what you’d expect for a powerful gaming machine — decent for everyday use, but obviously better when plugged in for gaming. Still, for the performance you get, it’s absolutely worth it.

Overall, if you’re looking for a reliable, powerful gaming laptop that delivers top-tier performance without breaking a desktop setup, this one is a great pick. Highly recommend it for gamers, streamers, and anyone who wants serious power in a portable setup.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"I’ve been using this gaming laptop for a little while now, and I’m honestly impressed with how well it performs.

The unboxing was like the previous Asus laptop I got. As soon as you open up the lid, the laptop pops up for easy access to that, as well as the power brick and documentation.                                                                 

As usual with my gaming laptops, I install a few games, then get some readings, to see where we are at the “new” stage.                                                                                                                             

Before all that, I wanted to talk about the ease of cracking into the internals. 
Whether to change batter or whatever, ASUS has made the access unbelievably
 easy with their tool-less access.
They really shine with that move.

I have already installed a second SSD drive, and it took less than 5 minutes. 
They don’t have a screw to hold down the SSD but rather a little quick release knob.


Internally, Asus has what they are calling “intelligent cooling”, which they claim will keep the CPU 15 degrees cooler.                                                                                                                        
                                                                               
As far as the keyboard the main thing I must have is a number pad, which this has due
to the full-size keyboard. 
That really is one of the things I really make sure it includes.     

Gaming so far has been awesome. The fans are not loud, but you do hear (unless wearing headphones) them speed up when they need to.

5,"Large laptop, large value","The Asus ROG Strix G18 laptop is a great gaming laptop that has all the specs and features to be a daily gamer.  Asus has two lines of ROG gaming laptops: Strix and Zephyrus.  Both contain all the latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5000 series video cards and the latest Intel Core Ultra processors.  The main difference is the thinness of each laptop.  The Zephyrus is nice and thin but suffers from one major annoyance, heat.  Because of how thin it is, the moving of air to keep the laptop cool is not as possible as the Strix series.  Since it’s a bit thicker, the fans are bigger and allow more air to be pushed so the laptop stays cooler during heavy gaming.  The 18” screen is great for gaming because of how much real estate is possible to see the entire scene of the game.  It may not be the latest OLED screen, but most people would not know the difference.  Colors and brightness are no problem with this display.  The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 is whisper quiet thanks to the innovative airflow built into the laptop.  Games run smoothly and graphic intensive applications such as video editing and 3D modeling run without a hiccup.  Call of Duty, no problem.  Marvel Rivals, no problem.  Adobe Premiere, no problem.  Asus has built into the computer a lot of quality-of-life improvements such as a row of quick access buttons to set fan speeds, brightness, mouse pad lock, and LED lighting.

4,Good Gaming Laptop but…,"I tested this laptop out for a few weeks and I have to say that the 18 inch screen is amazing. You can tell the difference between this and a OLED screen when it comes to color clearly in OLED screen pops, but this screen does a good job of displaying the colors and have an 18 inches of real estate to game on as a plus. Another feature I liked is the face recognition to unlock the laptop. I will say I tried playing a game like Fortnite on all three modes, silent performance and turbo, and the first thing I noticed was that it doesn’t truly handle the FPS as well as it should once it starts ramping up. This thing gets very loud (fan noise) in performance and turbo mode and after a couple games, your FPS starts to drop even in performance the most I could get was about 130 FPS, which is still decent but this thing should be pushing close to 200. Overall I think this is a great laptop I just think that the price doesn’t justify the performance. I do think that out of the 18 inch displays that are available right now, this is the best. But it’s not the best gaming laptop on the market right now for a RTX 5080.

5,Maximum PWNAGE!,"I am always impressed how Asus keeps raising the bar, over and over and over!  I've been a hug Asus fan for over a decade.  I use their motherboards (Strix and TUF), video cards, power supplies and even some peripherals.   When I need a laptop I've had a few other brands but always gravitate to Asus.  Vivobooks are an awesome value for business or school but gaming laptops always push boundaries.  I think my first gaming laptop was a G1 and everyone thought it was an AW.  Stylish and powerful.  What more do you need?

I've settled in on Strix and Zephyrus laptops as my workhorse... for both work and play.  The 16"" are luggable and great for work.  Not too heavy or bulky and fit most laptop bags.  The 18"" variants are more of a desktop replacement but even still, if determined, you can lug them just as easily but you need a spacious bag.  

The specs on this beast are amazing.   Cram the Intel Ultra 9 HX into the case along with 32GB of replaceable DDR5-5600 SODIMM memory, a nVidia GeForce RTX5080 (mobile chip) and yes... finally a 2TB SSD.  I was always stymied why manufacturers were stuffing 512GB or if lucky 1TB SSDs in a gaming laptop.  Storage is key for a high performance gaming system... a lot of the AAA games take up gobs of space so the 2TB is welcome!!!!  Even better is there is a spare NVME M.2  drive slot for an easy way to add to your storage.  Back on memory for a second, the growing trend of soldering in at least one stick of RAM onto the motherboard is horrible and Asus doesn't bend to that practice, keeping with replaceable SODIMM sticks.  

While my previous Zephyrus G16 go scorching hot in the space between the keyboard and screen.  That is not the case with this one.  Cooling has gotten much better... more heat pipes that move the generated heat easily out of the shell.  

Pairing the RTX5080 with the 240Hz IPS display at 3ms response time gives you the awe-factor you look for in gaming.  The 16:10 aspect ratio at 2560 x 1600 2.5K screen produces amazing clarity and 500 nits of brightness produces bright colors.  Along with all the other hardware produces amazing frame rates and of course that depends on what game you are playing.  

Lots of RGB but glad it doesn't have the annoying lit slash on the lid that last year's Zephyrus had.  Turned that off quickly!  The keyboard has programmable RGB and I really love the translucent WASD-RF-Space keys.  I use the numpad for work so the G18 gets me that with the extra real estate over the G16.

Plenty of I/O ports that make connectivity a breeze.  Left side you have power (rectangular connector instead of the usual barrel), ethernet, HDMI 2.1, USB-A 3.2, 2 Thunderbolt USB-Cs and headphone jack.  On the right there are 2 USB-A 3.2.  Wifi-7 provides the fast network connection needed when playing demanding games as long as your wifi system supports the faster speeds.  

Upgrading this system is a breeze.  Gone are the bazillion case screens... okay... maybe 12 that you have to not lose and them grab the guitar picks and pry the bottom off.  No sir, now it's a simple slide button on the bottom towards the front and once slid into the unlock position you slide the bottom forward and it's off.  I personally don't see the need to upgrade the memory but you can definitely add that second NVME drive.  For me... I tossed in a 4TB SSD and slid the bottom back on and the latch snapped to the locked position.

Sound from the speakers is okay, could use a bit more bass for my liking but still more than adequate and nothing really to complain about.

All in all bravo Asus.  A well designed and beastly equipped machine.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"I am always impressed how Asus keeps raising the bar, over and over and over!  I've been a hug Asus fan for over a decade.  I use their motherboards (Strix and TUF), video cards, power supplies and even some peripherals.   When I need a laptop I've had a few other brands but always gravitate to Asus.  Vivobooks are an awesome value for business or school but gaming laptops always push boundaries.  I think my first gaming laptop was a G1 and everyone thought it was an AW.  Stylish and powerful.  What more do you need?

I've settled in on Strix and Zephyrus laptops as my workhorse... for both work and play.  The 16"" are luggable and great for work.  Not too heavy or bulky and fit most laptop bags.  The 18"" variants are more of a desktop replacement but even still, if determined, you can lug them just as easily but you need a spacious bag.  

The specs on this beast are amazing.   Cram the Intel Ultra 9 HX into the case along with 32GB of replaceable DDR5-5600 SODIMM memory, a nVidia GeForce RTX5080 (mobile chip) and yes... finally a 2TB SSD.  I was always stymied why manufacturers were stuffing 512GB or if lucky 1TB SSDs in a gaming laptop.  Storage is key for a high performance gaming system... a lot of the AAA games take up gobs of space so the 2TB is welcome!!!!  Even better is there is a spare NVME M.2  drive slot for an easy way to add to your storage.  Back on memory for a second, the growing trend of soldering in at least one stick of RAM onto the motherboard is horrible and Asus doesn't bend to that practice, keeping with replaceable SODIMM sticks.  

While my previous Zephyrus G16 go scorching hot in the space between the keyboard and screen.  That is not the case with this one.  Cooling has gotten much better... more heat pipes that move the generated heat easily out of the shell.  

Pairing the RTX5080 with the 240Hz IPS display at 3ms response time gives you the awe-factor you look for in gaming.  The 16:10 aspect ratio at 2560 x 1600 2.5K screen produces amazing clarity and 500 nits of brightness produces bright colors.  Along with all the other hardware produces amazing frame rates and of course that depends on what game you are playing.  

Lots of RGB but glad it doesn't have the annoying lit slash on the lid that last year's Zephyrus had.  Turned that off quickly!  The keyboard has programmable RGB and I really love the translucent WASD-RF-Space keys.  I use the numpad for work so the G18 gets me that with the extra real estate over the G16.

5,Performance - by the pound!,"To reiterate the title - for every ounce of weight of this laptop (omg is it heavy), you will get top rated gaming performance.  I guess if you're into weighted blankets, you would want this on your lap while in use.  Other than that, some other downsides:

-You're going to want to plug this in unless you're gaming for only like an hour at a time
-Fan noise can get high
-Puts off some heat

I loaded up Elder Scrolls Oblivion Remastered from XBox GamePass as I heard it is a machine crippler - I don't think I've ever seen such a beautiful game delivered without any sort of performance hit in the least.  The visuals were great, though some may want to try to make the blacks 'blacker'.  Absolutely no tearing of any kind.  Sound was great for a laptop, though I'd suspect most gamers would be wielding headsets anyway.  In the same vain, the touchpad - which worked as expected - is not something I would ever use while gaming - it just seemed to take up more space than needed.  I hooked up an XBox game controller via Bluetooth without any issues.

Lots of hard drive space to fill up with games.

Lots of customization options with the built in Asus apps.  If you're into LEDs, there's loads of them.  I liked the treatment of them for the AWSD keys which are normally used for movement.  The one 'gimmick' I wasn't a huge fan of was the laser light show the laptop generated while sitting idle.  I just haven't taken the time to see if that was a thing I could disable.  Other than that, the laptop looks great in general.

Other highlights:
-Ethernet port
-Charging cord length was good, though the power brick - again - heavy/big.
-Tool-less entry was a little fiddly but once you get it, it is nice, though I don't know what I'd be doing inside this machine anytime soon",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"To reiterate the title - for every ounce of weight of this laptop (omg is it heavy), you will get top rated gaming performance.

5,This is a gaming monster!,"To do this review, I had my gamer son assist me in testing the Asus ROG Strix G18 and I wrote the review based on our mutual thoughts on the computer. I would consider myself average to somewhat advanced gamer, but my son is next level and is pretty gifted at gaming (and humbles me quicker than I care to admit). So, this is an honest review from someone that was extremely impressed with this computer and logged a lot of RPG hours in doing this review. When I look for a gaming computer, I want something that can pull it's weight. With tech always getting bigger, better and faster, it often comes down to a few brands and Asus is always a brand to look at first. The Asus ROG Strix G18 is more than just a strong performer, it feels like it was legitimately made with gamers in mind. Like taking feedback from the field and applying those considerations. It incorporates the top hardware, an advanced cooling system, a superior display, and a top-quality build. For me as a gamer/reviewer this is the best gaming computer I personally have had the chance to review. In this review I will focus on the Processor, GPU, cooling system, the display and build quality. I will then tell you why I like it so much. You can then decide if it would be a good option for you. 

The heart of the G18 is the Intel Core i9-13980HX. The 24 core (not a typo) processor is among the most powerful processors on the market today. That includes 8 performance cores and 16 efficiency cores. Performance cores handle the demanding tasks and are faster, while the efficiency cores are just that, more efficient and handle the background tasks. For a gamer, this means more than simply high frame rates. It means you can multitask. Specifically, you can game, stream, record and/or browse with superior performance, without slowing your system down. I tested this playing a few different FPS games with the setting placed on high. I had various chrome tabs open, running OBS to stream and listening to some music. No stutters or any sort of delay what so ever, everything was smooth. Everything loaded quickly, background taskers were still responsive and demanding software runs smooth as silk. This kind of CPU performance is beneficial for gamers, as this core power makes sure your games never lag even with other programs running in the background. This computer will handle anything you throw at it. 

For any gaming computer, the graphics card is going to maximize the experience, and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX series in the G18 is a powerhouse. These are some of the fastest mobile GPUs available, and they effectively revolutionized the gaming laptop. I tested the G18 with the RTX 4080 model, and the performance was spectacular! Again the FPS's ran smoothly on the ultra settings and it was better than anything else I have owed or tested to date on a laptop.

If you prioritize frame rate, this GPU is for you. In the FPS games I tested, I was consistently pushing frame rates well over 200 FPS on the high settings, allowing me to enjoy that crisp 240Hz display. That smoothness can give you a competitive edge over others especially in the fast-moving FPS games where fractions of a second mean a lot. The RTX 40-series also supports something called hardware-accelerated ray tracing. This brings a more realistic look to the shadows, reflections and lighting. 

So for a machine running this hard all the time, ASUS apparently understood it needed any equally high performing cooling system. So they utilize a three-fan cooling system with Conductonaut Extreme liquid metal on the CPU. This set up allows the ROG Strix G18 to run cool under the stress load.  I stress-tested the system with long gaming sessions, and I was surprised at how well it held up. Even after several hours of playing Starfield on ultra settings, the chassis remained comfortable to the touch and the system didn’t throttle performance due to overheating.

For gamers, when a system gets too hot, it can affect the performance of your CPU or GPU to protect the hardware, which leads to lag and frame rate drops. With this advanced cooling system, the G18 delivers even performance when you are playing extended gaming sessions. The fans tend to kick in when needed, but they are extremely quiet and of zero distraction. ASUS also allows you to adjust performance and fan profiles using ""Armoury Crate,"" so you can go full send with the fans when you are gaming harder, or you can limit the fan use when you are doing lighter work. 
This laptop features a rather large 18"" display. The QHD+ (2560x1600) Nebula display with a 240Hz refresh rate. That combo is perfect for anything from competitive gaming to watching a movie. The high resolution provides sharper images as you would expect. What I also learned was that it allows you to use more of your screen than when you compare it to the standard 1080p, Of course the high refresh rate ensures smooth motion while viewing or playing. 

The color is another big plus. The panel supports 100% DCI-P3 color, making colors appear to me as more accurate. Blacks and shadows are deep and rich, and the highlights really stand out. When playing competitively, the combo of high frame rates and low latency creates a super responsive experience that can help improve gameplay. 

The ROG Strix G18 is a large and heavy laptop, but that is because it is loaded with high end components. It has sharp lines highlighted by lighting. The thing just feels substantial and durable, like you would expect a really gaming machine to be. The keyboard is comfortable with a substantially deep press and the keys light up in a manner that does not affect your visibility of the keys with a nice key response.

There are plenty of port options on the G18, with multiple USB-A and USB-C ports, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, and a full-sized SD card slot. Again, another reason this laptop would be great for gamers and creators. The touchpad is large, and the large chassis leaves enough room for quality speakers that sound excellent.  This is not something that is designed to carry with you all the time, so its not exactly portable. But by far, this is the most portable laptop with the closest to desktop level performance that I have tried to date. But it is a bit heavy in that respect. Personally?  I will trade the weight for this level of performance. 

So I spent a lot of time with the G18, and I have to say it impresses me a lot. Gamers demand certain things, and this hits all the marks. The processing performance and excellent choice for a GPU and an extremely smooth and responsive display. You pay for these options for sure, and there are cheaper options out there. But this is definitely an instance where you get what you pay for. Pull the trigger on this one folks, you won't regret it. I HIGHLY recommend this laptop to anyone wanting a superior gaming computer in a more compact form. Or any influencer wanting the ultimate platform to create their content.

designed to carry with you all the time so its not exactly portable but by far this is the most portable laptop with the closest to desktop level performance that i have tried to date but it is a bit heavy in that respect personally i will trade the weight for this level of performance so i spent a lot of time with the g18 and i have to say it impresses me a lot gamers demand certain things and this hits all the marks the processing performance and excellent choice for a gpu and an extremely smooth and responsive display you pay for these options for sure and there are cheaper options out there but this is definitely an instance where you get what you pay for pull the trigger on this one folks you won t regret it i highly recommend this laptop to anyone wanting a superior gaming computer in a more compact form or any influencer wanting the ultimate platform to create their content you will be happy with your decision,5,1.0,POSITIVE,0.9993151426315308,0.9993151426315308,0.9996575713157654,0.9996575713157654,1,1,1
4,Near Perfect BEAST!!!!,"This is not the daily commuter,  student laptop, or just to Netflix and chill.    
This is for the hardcore gamer, developer, video editor, or designer (or all of the above). 
Perfect for those that are tight on space or need to move around. 

I have been around technology a long time, this is one of the most powerful laptops I have ever used.   While not the biggest, it is big compared to most laptops today, but it uses all of that space for good. 

This full 18"" monitor is GORGEOUS, detailed color, bright, just enough bezel to allow your eyes to stay focused on the screen for what ever you are doing.   

Sturdy and firm casing, you can feel it... this isn't flimsy, doesn't dip or tilt like some other large screen mobile devices.   

Full sized keyboard with number keypad... Great for a long list of reasons, a lot of laptops get rid of it... it's here and present. 

My first dislike, is the big oversized touchpad.    I am not a fan of touchpads, especially large ones, that then take a lot of space at the bottom of the deck.    Being a touch typist, for almost 40 years, it is a little awkward, but not crazy bad. There is just a lot of space.. .Bling it up with stickers :) 

RJ-45 hard line port, HDMI, and your standard USB assortment of ports.   

Now for my next negative... Power. 
The power brick is BIG!!! and heavy.  I get it, this big computer needs the power. 
However, it has a custom power connector to the computer on the side.   First would have loved it in the back, as the firm cord, jets out further to the left side, and then with its custom port.. can't readily get a replacement.     Seems to be compatible with USB-C charging, but haven't tried pushing it. 

Thunderbolt ports are going to be really nice, to connect to large monitors.   Only tried a single basic connection, worked great, was able to handle my wide screen, with no decline in image performance.    

It runs Windows out of the box, not going to review Windows, there are thousands of reviews out there.    However, I will say that it took about 2 hours to get it all setup, software and hardware updates, and ready to go.   

Once setup though, here comes the performance. 

From a gaming point of view, I put it through the most recent Forza, and connected a XBOX controller to play.     Racing and graphics was super smooth.  The 5080 graphic card, did its job.    The computer though didn't even seem like it was pushing itself.    Fans were minimal.    And the game play was great.   no issues at all. 

From a design point of view, I fired up Adobe Suite, and was able to do my normal Illustrator usage and editing.  The big screen was great, and I was able to send it over to my CNC machine and do its work.    I don't do a lot of video editing, but did try it out, and full size videos were playing with no hiccups.  Rendering some quick edits were fast, very little lag.     Uploads to YouTube were quick on my WiFi, that clocked at over 600mps, but I was far from my WiFi7 access point, so this was on WiFi6. 

Lastly I fired up Visual Studio, to do some sample compiles, and it was great. 
I typically code on my Mac, but now with this, I will be able to use this Unreal or Unity development, as my Mac is tapping out on that. 


This is going to be a laptop I can use for a long time. 
Outstanding piece of equipment, looking forward to more title releases in 2025 and 2026, that can tap into all its power.

5,What a beast of a gaming laptop,"The ASUS - ROG Strix G18 18"" 2.5K 240Hz Gaming Laptop - Intel Core Ultra 9 HX - 32GB RAM - NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 - 2TB SSD - Eclipse Gray is one beast of a laptop!

This ROG Strix G18 laptop comes well packaged as it should as the ROG Strix G18 is a heavy laptop indeed at just over 7lbs, as it needs to be with its stunning 18"" WQXGA and all the heat sink's inside to cool the system while in demand like playing games. 

The power supply brick that comes with the ROG Strix G18 is huge as it needs to be, especially plugged in during gameplay, that is required as this Asus laptop need the power to get you the best you can be visually and without lag.   The setup went extremely easy and quick.  The ROG Strix G18 comes with 3 months of pc game pass.  

The display is just a tad below OLED,  meaning  blacks are near perfect black.  Colors are stunning, watching movies are stunning with perfect visuals.  Playing games is just outstanding visually, also just perfect motion at playing games at 240htz.  The display is perfect at everything and stunning! 
Pictures look stunning, movies look stunning, games look stunning.  Viewing angles are great also.  I just love having an 18"" high end display built in, basically no need for anything bigger.

The sound this laptop produces is stunning for a laptop, certainly not high end sound system type (as expected) but certainly surprised on how great the speakers sound.

Wifi 7 works great, super fast connection and definitely delivers on minimal lag in games, just like playing while plugged into Ethernet.

The keyboard is just wow, you can set the color of your choice as the backlight.  The keys feel great and placement of the keys is perfect. I love having a number pad.

Playing games on the ROG Strix G18 is just wow, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 with the Intel Core Ultra 9 HX processor, this combo has so much power for present and future games.   Playing games on this without any lag is just mind blowing.  The response of the entire laptop and hearing the fans kick up when the 16 gigabytes of GPU ram of GDDR7 is used and you see and feel it while playing games, nice and smoothly as it should be.  Asus just got everything perfect in syncing everything perfectly.  You can max out all visualls in games and this Asus laptop just handles all aspects perfectly.  I saw absolutely no studder, jitter or game lag.

I was blown away at what games look like when you have all the power you need to get you to a point and beyond of stunning visuals and extremely smooth gameplay, that is extremely greatfull, so you have that advantage over others!

You will not be disappointed!

5,Laptop gaming beast!,"This laptop is a beast in the best possible way. Yes, it’s fairly expensive, but you get a beautiful, high-performance, portable gaming machine. In a nutshell, it runs cool, the fans are not too noisy, the graphics performance is top-notch, and the 18” monitor is beautiful. It is a little on the heavy side (a bit more than 7lbs) but it’s perfectly fine to haul to those occasional game nights with friends. 
At home, I typically use it with a Samsung 49” Odyssey Neo which it handles perfectly. My old gaming laptop would have some annoying stutter at times during lots of screen movement, but so far, the ASUS has been butter smooth for me. But if you don’t have or want to mess with an external monitor, the 18” monitor on the laptop is perfectly fine.
It was easy to get set up initially. After the Windows updates were done, I started installing games via Microsoft Xbox. There are some useful ASUS utilities for system performance, graphics, etc. but very little in the way of annoying bloatware like on some computers these days. The 2TB drive gives me plenty of room, so I’m not worried about having to expand any time soon. 
You can read all the specs and other details of the system, so I won’t go into that, but here are some features I like. The RGB lightbar that outlines the underneath side of the laptop is a nice touch. It’s not something that would have influenced my purchasing decision, but now that I have it, I really like it. The chamfered edges of the laptop are a nice touch, too, and it makes the laptop seem a little sleeker. 
My favorite feature, though, is the tool-less access to the RAM, SSD, and fans on the back. I don’t know why every system made from now on would NOT have this kind of simple access. Not that I’m going to be messing with the RAM and SSD all the time, but it will be nice to be able to make sure the fans are staying clean. I do have cats that like to lay around near the computers, so this is going to be great for keeping the air flow clean.
Speaking of the fans and airflow, another nice design feature is the hot air is vented out the back and not to the sides. So many laptops over the years would blow hot air out the side right onto your mouse hand, which I found annoying. With this laptop, the intakes are on the side and the vents are on the rear. 
One small detail that would have been nice is a power connector that was a 90-degree elbow instead of straight out. The power cord does stick out quite a way on the left side and my only concern is about bumping it or possibly smashing it into something. If it had a 90-degree turn, then it would be a sleeker fit and could route towards the back. Having said that, when I’m using it with an HDMI cable plugged in, then they’re both sticking out about the same, so it doesn’t matter as much.
Overall, I’m super impressed with gaming on this computer. I feel like it’s top-of-the-line enough that it’s going to continue running my games for years to come.  If this type of machine is within your budget, I think you’ll be very happy with the ASUS ROG Strix G18.",Yes,ASUS_REVIEWS_FIXED.csv,asus,"This laptop is a beast in the best possible way.

5,What a machine!,"WOW.  I wish I could write this review and just leave it there.  I have had other high end gaming laptops in the past but never have I been this blown away by the performance, versatility, look, and feel of one of these machines.

First off, the unboxing and packaging.  The box that this unit arrived in was just a cool presentation as it lifted the laptop up slightly when opened giving the vibe of premium right out of the gate.  Not much included in the box, small instruction and warranty paperwork, the charger, and the laptop itself and you're set.

The physical feel of this machine just screams premium.  The materials feel nice and at 18"" on the screen it's large.  I do not intend to do much travelling with this and rather mostly treat it like a desktop that takes up way less space, but if you did want to travel with it, you need a large and sturdy bag.  The keyboard is of course RGB backlit and there is even lighting around the bottom to give it that ""gamer"" look.

Booting up, setting up, etc was very quick.  It's very fast, but standard windows setup.  Immediately moved into downloading some games from the Xbox PC app (I have Gamepass, highly recommend) and getting Steam going.  I've tried a few things from indie titles that are not very intense up to the latest releases and some free to play titles.  Everything I have tried has run very smoothly and looked very impressive whether I used the built in monitor or hooked up to my normal docking station.  Speaking of docking, The setup to connect to my triple monitor, gaming keyboard and mouse, external webcam and mic docking station was absolutely seamless.  I've even done a bit of twitch streaming on this system and had no issues.

Overall, this unit carries an premium price tag and it delivers.  As the PC gaming industry trends more towards portability and ease of use with products like this as well as handheld options like the Steamdeck and upcoming Xbox branded ROG Ally, this premium price point delivers on everything I can think of or could want from a high end gaming laptop.

The box that this unit arrived in was just a cool presentation as it lifted the laptop up slightly when opened giving the vibe of premium right out of the gate.  Not much included in the box, small instruction and warranty paperwork, the charger, and the laptop itself and you're set.

The physical feel of this machine just screams premium.  The materials feel nice and at 18"" on the screen it's large.  I do not intend to do much travelling with this and rather mostly treat it like a desktop that takes up way less space, but if you did want to travel with it, you need a large and sturdy bag.  The keyboard is of course RGB backlit and there is even lighting around the bottom to give it that ""gamer"" look.

Booting up, setting up, etc was very quick.  It's very fast, but standard windows setup.  Immediately moved into downloading some games from the Xbox PC app (I have Gamepass, highly recommend) and getting Steam going.  I've tried a few things from indie titles that are not very intense up to the latest releases and some free to play titles.  Everything I have tried has run very smoothly and looked very impressive whether I used the built in monitor or hooked up to my normal docking station.  Speaking of docking, The setup to connect to my triple monitor, gaming keyboard and mouse, external webcam and mic docking station was absolutely seamless.  I've even done a bit of twitch streaming on this system and had no issues.

Overall, this unit carries an premium price tag and it delivers.  As the PC gaming industry trends more towards portability and ease of use with products like this as well as handheld options like the Steamdeck and upcoming Xbox branded ROG Ally, this premium price point delivers on everything I can think of or could want from a high end gaming laptop.  If it's in your budget, this is the one to get.",wow i wish i could write this review and just leave it there i have had other high end gaming laptops in the past but never have i been this blown away by the performance versatility look and feel of one of these machines first off the unboxing and packaging the box that this unit arrived in was just a cool presentation as it lifted the laptop up slightly when opened giving the vibe of premium right out of the gate not much included in the box small instruction and warranty paperwork the charger and the laptop itself and you re set the physical feel of this machine just screams premium the materials feel nice and at 18 on the screen it s large i do not intend to do much travelling with this and rather mostly treat it like a desktop that takes up way less space but if you did want to travel with it you need a large and sturdy bag the keyboard is of course rgb backlit and there is even lighting around the bottom to give it that gamer look booting up setting up etc was very quick it s very fast but standard windows setup immediately moved into downloading some games from the xbox pc app i have gamepass highly recommend and getting steam going i ve tried a few things from indie titles that are not very intense up to the latest releases and some free to play titles everything i have tried has run very smoothly and looked very impressive whether i used the built in monitor or hooked up to my normal docking station speaking of docking the setup to connect to my triple monitor gaming keyboard and mouse external webcam and mic docking station was absolutely seamless i ve even done a bit of twitch streaming on this system and had no issues overall this unit carries an premium price tag and it delivers as the pc gaming industry trends more towards portability and ease of use with products like this as well as handheld options like the steamdeck and upcoming xbox branded rog ally this premium price point delivers on everything i can think of or could want from a high end gaming laptop if it s in your budget this is the one to get,5,1.0,NEGATIVE,0.9861350655555725,-0.9861350655555725,0.006932467222213745,0.006932467222213745,1,0,1

1,"Multiple buying attempts, all freezing issues","I have attempted to purchase 3 of these ROG Strix 18"" laptops since February. Every single one of them had freezing issues.

I am a system builder, and I know my way around Windows, drivers, updates, SSDs,  ect. I know Asus machines very well. My 5 year old gaming Asus ROG machine is still running to this day.

I don't know WHAT is going on with these machines, but they are NOT ready for release. The first one I bought had faulty wiring in it, and the backlit keyboard would not work. The second and third ones worked fine for a couple of days, and then started freezing. No Blue Screen of Death. Straight up, freezing. Everything would just lock up. No mouse movements, no keyboard response, nothing. I needed to hold down the power button for a hard reset. Afterward, it would boot up normally, and moments after it would totally freeze again. The LED light next to the charging port would just rapidly flash a while color.

I had all the latest Windows Updates, I had all the latest BIOS and drivers from the My Asus app. This happened on 2 machines in the span of 3 days.

These are not ready for release, and with the amount of software and licenses I have to assign to my machines and what not, this is unacceptable. At this price point, these things should be 1000% flawless right out of the box.

I will not buy another Asus laptop again. This has been by fat the worse computer experience I have ever had. And I am a 25 year system builder. It's a shame, because specs wise these are impressive. Nothing but issues with them.

It very well could be BIOS or driver update related.

5,All it's cracked up to be.,"Cons: It's huge, and the cord isn't very long nor the battery life great, thus, not a great curl up on the couch and write laptop, but I have an aging lightweight dell that still works fine as a basic word processor, and I had zero expectations for a gaming laptop to have a good battery life. It can get toasty, but no more than other gaming laptops, and you definitely do not need any external cooling fans or anything. It's a little slow on startup and doesn't recognize my USB mouse right away, but that's trivial compared to the pros. Fingerprints easily show up on the pretty casing. Hate the huge copilot key, which could have been made miniscule so the home and end keys could be more conveniently located. FYI: I ordered mostly top specs as far as 5090 and 64 gig ram. Only did the 2TB gen4 SSD as I'd hit (ahem, exceeded) my budget max already, but it might have been worth the bigger and gen5 SSD to better future proof, maybe, maybe not. Pros: It's very pretty. Flawlessly runs KCD2, BG3, and heavily modded skyrim, all at max graphics, and is very pretty and fluid on the attached screen or when hooked up to 65 inch TV. I don't game online so I can't say how it performs, but the download speeds over wifi are impressive, so I suspect that wouldnt be a problem. Overall a huge upgrade from my prior PCs, such as my aging Alienware desktop and my prior 4060 laptop, which could run the above mentioned games at medium graphics yet still lagged. Easily runs other apps like photoshop, of course. Overall: Highly recommend.

The cooling system is a triumph. Even during intense sessions, the laptop remains remarkably cool, preventing thermal throttling. The fans are a pleasant ""whoosh"" and unnoticeable with a headset. The Cherry MX mechanical keyboard offers tactile feedback and comfortable, responsive typing. Per-key AlienFX RGB lighting adds personalization.

I upgraded to 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a blazing-fast 2TB NVMe M.2 PCIe Gen5 SSD, ensuring lightning-quick load times. AAA titles run at max settings with incredible frame rates, rivaling desktop setups. The cooling system is a triumph. Even during intense sessions, the laptop remains remarkably cool, preventing thermal throttling. The fans are a pleasant ""whoosh"" and unnoticeable with a headset. The Cherry MX mechanical keyboard offers tactile feedback and comfortable, responsive typing. Per-key AlienFX RGB lighting adds personalization. Though large, its portability for a machine of this caliber is impressive, perfect for LAN parties. The array of ports, including Thunderbolt 5, is convenient. In conclusion, the Alienware 18"" Area-51 is an absolute triumph. It's a no-compromise gaming machine delivering an unparalleled experience. For serious gamers seeking the best in mobile performance, stunning visuals, and a premium build, this is an investment in pure gaming bliss.

5,Real quality in laptop thermal design.,"I tried about 3 other 5000 series laptops before picking the Alienware 18 inch with a 5090 in it, I have to say I am not disappointed. I have never seen thermals so good in a laptop, ever and I've managed two computer stores repairing laptops in the past. It draws in air from the top! Why have I never seen this in a laptop before, the fans aren't loud and even while benchmarking it does not thermal throttle, I get temps on the 5090 in the 60 most of the time while playing, sometime 71 max and 70 for the CPU.. this exact config on the HP omen max hit 105c after one minute of benchmarking. Screen is not OLED but it's still a great screen probably best I've seen on an IPS display, build quality is solid and nice, the typing experience with the cherry mx keys is awesome I get a great score on monkey type, similar to my ergo desktop keyboard score. This is a beast the only thing I would warn you is it's HUGE and heavy but the 16 inch variant does not perform as well as this one, if you are considering one versus the other get the 18 and go big you won't regret it.

5,Absolutely gorgeous machine,"The cooling solution (the cryochamber) in this beauty is absolutely doing a spectacular job. Solid 10/5! I don't recall ever seeing a high end gaming laptop with cooling this good! (From Alienware or otherwise). The Intel Ultra Core 275hx and the RTX 5080 actually go to their advertised speeds of 160W and 175W respectively with a combined power up to 280W under constant load favouring the GPU or CPU based on the power/thermal profile used. With 4 speakers (2 woofers and 2 tweeters) you can probably hold a party with this machine! (The speakers are that load yes!) 2 SODIMM slots with memory up to 6400MT/s + 3 Nvme Gen 5 Slots + 2 Thunderbolt 5 slots + 5Gbit Ethernet, Full size SD card, regular Type A usb 3 ports, I couldn't ask for more (perhaps a mini-displayport port would have been nice, but we get a full HDMI 2.1 port - not the mini version of it, so no complaints there). I love the Liquid Teal colour. It reminds me of Alienware of old! Only gripe is that the screen is IPS and not OLED, but I don't want glossy OLED, I would have liked a matte OLED screen (Valve was able to do it for the Steam Deck OLED, so maybe next time Alienware can do it as well ^_^). However, the IPS at 500+ nits and 100% DCIP-3 accuracy is one of the best IPS panels I have ever experienced and it's matte, which is a MAJOR WIN! It is ""thin"" at least compared to the previous Alienware Area-51m R2 (or R1) and it is a desktop replacement, but with just one power-brick this time instead of two (thank God!) My only recommendation is to grab the 18' backpack! I was absolutely impressed with the quality!

3,Powerful specs inside stylish laptop let down down by screen,"I got this laptop to replace my 8 year old XPS. I wasn't keen on Dell's new design of the XPS and wanted something that could house the latest generation of Nvidia GPU's. The Area 51 (18inch) ticked all the boxes - the chassis is well designed and looks very stylish indeed. So far I am very impressed with it and its thermal control when playing games appears to be very good for a laptop. I was left disappointed by the screen quality however. I had to return my first delivery as there was clearly a dead pixel (or a few) in the corner of the screen. I didn't notice any backlight bleed (BLB), but I only had the laptop on for a short time and had used it in a bright room. There are no dead pixels on the second one I ordered and kept, but the backlight bleeding and ips glow is noticeable when the screen is showing dark colours or if I'm not sat in a bright room. Reducing the brightness does help, but it's clear to see if I haven't got a light on. I understand that BLB and IPS glow are to be expected to some degree with this type of screen, but I would say the extent I have with my Area 51 laptop is the worst I've ever seen on an IPS screen and just barely acceptable for product in this price range. It's a shame really when everything else is so good. Perhaps I'm expecting too much from the technology, but when your paying several thousand for a laptop it should look and feel premium all over. Outside of dark colours, the screen does indeed look very good with no noticeable blemishes. I prefer to have an IPS screen for a laptop that's going to be used for games and music production/performance (over say an OLED which would cost a lot more and has it's own issues). I am happy enough with my purchase and hope this laptop will last as long as the last one I owned (the XPS felt flawless and was half the price). I just wonder if Dell could've done a better job ensuring the quality of the screen was on a par with the rest of the laptop prior to shipping. I would recommend it to someone who's prime consideration is having a portible, powerful machine with a well designed chassis for keeping all that tech cool.

5,Upgrade Blows My Desktop Away,"I purchased this laptop to replace my desktop that couldn’t upgrade to windows 11. The performance of this machine is absolutely night and day. I game, stream, and edit videos as some of my heavier tasks and my desktop was able to run these programs okay. They had to be on the lowest settings possible to run smoothly. With this laptop, everything is running on Highest settings and flawlessly at that. My biggest games are Overwatch 2, Anno 1800, and Hoyoverse titles. After some adjustments in the system settings (making sure the games were running on the dGPU instead of hybrid, etc) every title is running perfectly. You can set up and be playing in minutes. The OLED display is beautiful. It’s capable of HDR but I honestly prefer the OLED for gaming. It has a decent battery life. I don’t game while unplugged but while I’m unplugged just browsing or using discord, it lasts plenty long enough for me. I have not fully tested this yet however. 

I was upgrading from a GTX 1060, and I can tell the difference drastically. In FPS games, suddenly it makes sense how other people could use snipers and I couldn’t. The frames are just that much smoother, that much easier to work with. I was nervous to drop this kind of money on a laptop with how much gripe they get, but I have zero regrets. This thing is better than my desktop ever was, even 6 years ago. I have yet to run into an issue it can’t handle. It’s lighter than I thought it’d be too. Maybe slightly heavier than my old MacBook Pro? But not enough to be noticeable by any means.

5,Power house!,"I couldn’t be happier with my new Lenovo Legion 7i 16” OLED Gaming Laptop! From the moment I turned it on, the speed and clarity blew me away. The Intel Core Ultra 9 and RTX 5070 handle everything I throw at it — from AutoCAD and design software to gaming and video editing — all without breaking a sweat.

The OLED display is absolutely stunning; colors pop with incredible depth and the 2.5K resolution makes every detail shine. The build quality feels premium, the RGB keyboard is smooth and responsive, and even under heavy use, it stays surprisingly cool and quiet.

The OLED display is absolutely stunning; colors pop with incredible depth and the 2.5K resolution makes every detail shine. The build quality feels premium, the RGB keyboard is smooth and responsive, and even under heavy use, it stays surprisingly cool and quiet.

5,Lenovo Legion 7i,"The Legion 7i, especially its latest 2025 iteration (Gen 10), ships with cutting-edge specs like the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor paired with NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs—up to the RTX 5080—delivering jaw-dropping performance. In benchmarks, it leads the pack. Gaming and visuals come alive on its 16-inch, 240 Hz OLED WQXGA panel—vibrant, color-accurate, and silky-smooth. The Legion 7i combines a sleek, modern aesthetic with smart ergonomics. It garners praise for its clean design and abundant ports—including Thunderbolt 4, USB-C/A, HDMI 2.1, and RJ-45—ideal for gaming setups and creative workflows alike.
Thanks to its advanced cooling system, the CPU can consistently operate at ~150–170 W, even when under load, with temperatures around 85–90 °C and fan noise between 45–46 dBA—impressive for such power.
The Legion 7i’s SteelSeries-based keyboard delivers excellent tactile feedback, quiet typing, and unique features like force-sensing WASD keys and customizable keycaps—ideal for precision gaming.
Minor Trade-Offs
• Pricey & Heavy: The best-in-class hardware comes at a cost, both financially (starting around $2,849) and in portability (nearly 6 lb)
• Battery Life: Like most powerful gaming laptops, it has below-average battery endurance—not ideal for extended unplugged use.

5,Best looking laptop,"Got one refurbished-excellent on sale for $1380 before tax.

You pay for the build quality, and it’s worth the price.  It’s clean and professional, without any gaming aesthetic.  The display blew me and my girlfriend away even compared to other OLED laptop screens; she’s (jokingly) jealous of how good this thing is and she by no means skimped out on her own gaming laptop.  

I’m impressed by how powerful the 275HX CPU is as well, though it’s a little too powerful for the chassis.  It’s somehow got more computing power than my desktop 13700k at half the wattage; intel arrow lake isn’t impressive as a desktop chip but it’s a big improvement for laptop chips.  My legion 7 will thermal throttle well before the cpu is fully utilized; consider undervolting and frequency limiting or setting a custom fan curve since it’s got cpu horsepower to spare.

The GPU is the weakest point of this laptop; everyone complains the 5070 with 8gb vram is insufficient and it really does struggle with 1440p gaming.  There’s no getting around it; go for something with a 5070 ti or greater if graphics-heavy gaming is important.  Or, like, use a desktop instead.

I sure like how it looks though, and I think its aesthetics and build quality make up for its shortcomings in graphics, thermals and battery life compared to other laptops at a similar price.  At any sale price at $1700 or below I think this thing warrants consideration for anyone who doesn’t use a laptop solely for gaming.
