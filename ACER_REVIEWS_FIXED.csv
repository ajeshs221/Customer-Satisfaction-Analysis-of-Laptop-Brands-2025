5,Fast and Powerful!,"I've had it for about month and so I'm still amazed on how fast and powerful it is. Theres a button the top left of the keyboard that allows you to quickly change modes from quiet, balanced, performance and Turbo. I play on maxed out settings on turbo with ease. 

The Screen
This is the first laptop that i ever had to turn down the brightness because it is surprisingly BRIGHT! 80% is where I keep it. It's not 4k but still looks incredible. The refresh rate is smooth as butter when playing games or just browsing online.

Fan noise
I usually have it on balanced mode. When I'm watching movies, browsing online, YouTube or doing some work I don't hear the fan at all. But once I start playing a game this thing sounds like a jet about to take off. Definitely not for sneaking a game session at work or in a library. You will be heard lol. I bought a cooling pad that surprisingly can get louder than the laptop but it's to help make that laptop live a long life. I game with headphones so during gaming I don't anything but the game. I tried gaming without headphones and i did get used to the fan noise but headphones are the way to go.

The Sound
The sound can feel a bit deep but louder it sounds a bit piercing. The sound settings are a bit shallow. The sound did not wow me. I've heard Macbooks with better sound.

Battery
The battery does not last long at all. Even just browsing youtube it's going to last like 2.5hrs generously speaking. Unless you know you're going to use it for a short time somewhere then yeah that will work. But if you expect to game on t just battery then prepare for a short gaming session and lower performance on battery. It's the cost of having a high end GPU.

Games
Played newly released titles on ultra and it took it well with no hiccups. Cyberpunk, GTA V, Chronos, Dying light the beast ect. I play on turbo and with no apps playing in the background and I use a cooling pad fully maxed.

Overall
It's great if you buy when it's on sale. Battery sucks but if you're like me that always likes to have their laptop pluged in then yeah you'll be super happy with this. But if you're always on the go then this might be a bit of a struggle for you. I'm definitely happy with it.",Yes

4,Decent mid ranged laptop,Overall a good deal but I return mine as it was to slow for what I was doing. if your doing light gaming and editing its work fine. if you care about display it won't disappoint you,Yes
5,this thing is a beast!,"i got this laptop because it had the best specs and mobility for me is not a priority, basically just wanted to be able to take it with me and use it for long periods of time at other locations but not whipping it out constantly. i was able to buy additional ram and have geek squad install it",Yes
1,Overheating CPU,Even under only a 10% load the cpu is hitting 100 degrees Celsius. It's cooking itself because thermal paste may not have been applied at the factory or the heat pipes are broken. Sent it back to the manufacturer and they did not check for the problem I indicated and sent it back unrepaired. All of this is after the first one we bought had to be returned due to it being unrepairable because of a broken power port. Don't bother purchasing thi and stay away from the brand. .,No

2,Ubs c power delivery does not work,"Love the computer. But since the battery life is bad, my only hope was that it could be charged via usb c. In a way, it does. It charges, but only while the computer is off.",No
3,Beast performer for the price — average elsewhere,"Good with some compromises, amazing for up to intermediate gamers. This is my second one after I had to swap out my first one in less than 24 hours (thank you Best Buy Total otherwise I would have been stuck)—see Unfixable Cons below. I damaged the first one doing a simple unscrewing of the bottom plate.

Pros:
- Price – you can’t beat this price for the on-paper specs it has. You also get what you pay for, and there are weird limitations to the laptop’s power. More below.
- Screen is stunning. Crystal clear, super crisp, vibrant color, looks better than Retina in my opinion. For 240 Hz, which is plenty for me, this OLED screen is flawless, uncompromised and best in class.
- Size & aesthetics: it’s not stunningly lightweight, but not too heavy either. However, it is stupidly thin for a gaming laptop and very portable. Takes up slightly more room than the 16” Macbook Pro. This laptop is top notch looks with pretty lights and clean design, and it will turn heads. Some reviewers say the plastic on the back looks cheap. I simply disagree. This is a cool looking laptop.
- Numpad and keyboard – I love how this 16” laptop packs in a comfortable-to-use numpad. The key layout is really excellent, too. All keys are a full size, no awkward half keys. Full arrow keys, too.
- Performance – I’m running the GPU hungry game Black Myth: Wukong at well over 60 fps, even higher on my 1440p monitor. No tearing, no bottlenecking, super smooth, and gorgeous ray tracing. Though I describe many compromises below, Acer did NOT compromise on performance. It’s a beast performer on Turbo, and you will be able to run most games at ultra settings at HD resolutions at 1080p and 1440p. The 5070ti is capable of 4k performance, but I haven’t tested this.
- HDMI and Thunderbolt display support. I recommend not using a dock for video and using HDMI to USB-C direct to the laptop for best results.

Fixable cons / annoyances:
- Boot startup noise – Sounds like a running circular saw crashing through your window. If you’re setting up your laptop for the first time, you’re going to hear it a lot, and if your computer restarts in the middle of the night in another room, it will wake you. Turn it off immediately in BIOS.
- Bloatware – I recommend installing a clean copy of Windows, but be aware, you will need to backdoor the Intel RAID drivers during the installation. May be difficult for an intermediate Windows user. I opted to keep PredatorSense which is downloadable from Acer’s website, and actually has useful tools. Also, it comes with Windows 11 Home, so have a license ready if you require Pro.
- Heat – This thing gets REALLY hot. I recommend the Razer laptop cooling pad RC21-02300. Keeps it just a little warm during gaming sessions, cold to the touch during regular use.
- Hard drive replacement / expansion – don’t even think about upgrading the paltry 1 TB this comes with (I guess “you get what you pay for”). Your upgraded drive will have to be a secondary drive and will only be recognized by Windows (see cons for Linux note). I wanted to upgrade my main boot drive, and I had a painful time trying to backdoor the Intel drivers to make this work. 

Unfixable cons:
- Modifying – This is the HARDEST laptop I’ve had to modify yet. This laptop does not have easy access panels for upgrading the SSD or memory. Ten torx screws hold down the bottom plate, one of them stripped with no effort, and I warped the aluminum cover because that was the only option I had to remove the stripped screw. You’ll need a special screwdriver which I luckily had and a pry tool. The hard drive and the RAM are underneath thermal tape that is stuck on there pretty good, so use caution when removing. The nvme expansion slot exists, but it’s covered by the RAM’s thermal tape. Be very careful when taking apart, modifying and upgrading this laptop. Not novice friendly.
- No Linux – it is difficult to load Intel RAID drivers during a Windows Live USB installation. It is impossible with Linux. If you enjoy dual booting or maining Linux, you can’t do it with this laptop. Period. Alternative ways are running Linux on an external hard drive or running it through a virtual machine, but it is impossible to install and run on board. Comment if you know a way because I certainly don’t.
- FINGERPRINT MAGNET!! Looks like I eat nothing but fried chicken with how easy I get prints on the body.
- USB-C ports are only on the back of the unit. It’s awkward to reach around to find your USB-C port. I have a dock with front facing USB-C ports so I don’t mind. If I didn’t have that, this would be really annoying.
- Battery is butt. You might get an hour on a full charge and with eco settings. Realistically, you’ll get 45-ish minutes with average use. This is largely due to the inability to change refresh rates on the laptop screen, so your battery will heavily power the GPU. No way you’re doing any gaming without this thing plugged in to power. Wattage is limited to the GPU and CPU on battery, and thus games will run at abysmal framerates. I don’t know who out there is getting 3 hours of life, but that’s completely absurd. As this is my second unit, both units battery life was just horrible, so I doubt I have a defective battery.
- Speakers are the cheapest, tinniest laptop speakers I’ve ever heard since the 90s. All treble, zero bass, zero depth. You’ll need headphones or external speakers. The speakers do get nice and loud, but the louder it gets, the lousier the quality is. If quality onboard speakers are a must, pass this laptop up. You’ll hate these speakers.

Recommended based on the performance, aesthetics, and screen alone. It’s a great laptop if you’re mostly working and gaming at home. Not recommended if you need the complete experience to be quality. I won’t return it, but I can’t say I’m blown away by my experience. 3/5",No
5,BEST BANG FOR BUCK LAPTOP DURONG 1ST HALF OF 2025,"Let me be clear: THIS THING SLAPS.

Tl;dr: if you plan to keep it plugged to a wall and don’t mind bad speakers, don’t look any further. There’s no better deal for an OLED panel, high refresh rate, i9, 5070Ti 12GBVRam and upgradable ram and storage.  

If you want a more detailed review see below.

Let’s get the cons out of the way:
-Speakers are bad, but a good headset/headphones can easily fix this.
-Battery is awful right now, for some reason you can’t switch the refresh rate to anything that’s not 240Hz, which causes your battery to drain supeeer fast: 1 hour AAA gaming - 3 hours light use. BUT, this is probably something Acer will fix down the line with an update (or at least I hope so). Although, if you’re like me and only use it while plugged to the wall, then it’s really not an issue.
-Fans can get pretty loud on TURBO mode lol, but quiet and balance are really nice.
-This might be exclusive to my unit: there’s a noticeable hiss/high pitched noise that appears for a couple minutes before the fans start picking up during a heavy usage session. Might be able to fix it by opening it but haven’t done so.

TIME FOR THE PROS BABYYYY:
-16” 240HZ OLED BEAUTIFUL SCREEN? YESSSSSSIIIR
-UPGRADEABLE RAM AND STORAGE IN 2025? YESSSSSIIIIRRR

-IF YOU SEE THIS ON SALE, YOU GOT TO BUY IT. THE VALUE IS TOO GOOD MY GUYS.

Pro tip:
If you want to further improve air flow, put a book underneath the back part of the laptop to allow for more air intake. I travel a lot for work, and for some reason hotels in the US always have a certain book in their rooms lol, so I use those.",Yes
5,Fantastic Performance,"The performance on this system is impressive, given its price point. Every competitor is priced an additional $400-$600 more, given similar specs and display. The performance on many of the new releases has been excellent. I've been running Borderlands 4, getting 70-80fps on high using the 2k resolution with the monitor. Battlefield 6 has impressive performance, which I haven't benchmarked yet. Almost every other game released in the last 2 years seems to run at ultra settings, with ray tracing and shadows set to high, yet still maintaining very high frame rates. I recommend this PC. The one thing I would be mindful of is the heat, which will hamper performance if you can't find something like a book to prop it up or use one of those fan devices to help. As long as there is good airflow, this will run like a dream. It doesn't have a super-long battery life either. If you're out and about without wall power, I get 3-4 hours just doing everyday tasks like running Excel, PowerPoint, ArcGIS Pro, and a few other programs. Anything demanding will kick your battery down to an hour. It's still the best PC I've owned.",Yes
5,Thin little monster - Love this Laptop.,"Great Gaming Laptop - This thing flies, the CPU is a beast the GPU is amazing (throttled back - but a beast for this thin setup)  - Throw a 2TB in there and it's great.  32GB is plenty of ram gaming, 12g on the vram is excellent.   It gets hot, but it should... get a pad for this guy.  Screen is gorgeous at 1600 240hz oled.  Running Borderlands 4 no issues. (increase your shader cache!)",Yes
5,“Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI,"If you’re looking for a gaming laptop that leans more toward display quality + gaming performance (and you can live with trade-offs in noise, heat, and battery), the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI is a strong contender. Its OLED panel and raw gaming performance deliver great value for what you pay.",Yes
5,Amazing laptop for the price,"This is a great laptop for gaming, video editing and schoolwork/homework. It can handle hours of gaming, running multiple virtual machines or for doing homework for hours. The screen is OLED and its crystal clear, its light weight conpared to my older Helios 300 (2019) and the RTX 5070ti and ultra 9 cpu make it run smooth and fast. For the price it really is the best gaming laptop for your dollar, its worth every penny.",Yes
5,Amazing performance with beautiful display.,I’m amazed at the performance and how thin the laptop and is easy to carry around.Coupled with the beautiful oled display it makes it amazing to look at. The 12 gigs of vram is what really makes this laptop worth it I highly recommend.,Yes
3,Great Performance but Be Aware of Potential Issues,"I recently picked up this laptop and honestly it felt like a great deal for the price. It’s fast, handles games on high settings like a champ, and the RTX 5070 Ti is an absolute beast. I’ve had an overall great experience with performance whether it’s gaming or multitasking this thing handles it smoothly.

That said, there are a few drawbacks worth mentioning. The build quality could be better. The chassis is plastic and feels like it wouldn’t survive even a small drop without cracking. I get it though, at this price point some compromises are expected.

The biggest issue for me has been the touchpad and keyboard. The touchpad glitches out constantly. It becomes inaccurate or unresponsive to the point where it's almost unusable. It’s frustrating because everything else about the machine works so well. I didn’t get the warranty, big mistake on my part, so I’ll have to take it to a local shop and see if they can fix it.

Battery life could also be better. You’re most likely going to get around an hour and a half to two hours unplugged with just light usage. If you’re gaming, expect maybe 45 minutes to an hour tops, and performance is greatly reduced while running on battery power.

So would I recommend this laptop? Yes and no, It’s powerful, fast, and a solid choice for gaming. But be aware you might run into some hardware quirks. I’m not sure if my touchpad problem is a one-off or a common issue, but it’s worth keeping in mind. And definitely don’t skip the warranty.",No
5,Best bang for the buck on the market,"Absolutely incredible performance and value for the price. zero regrets. I wanted something under $2k that had top of the line specs including the top of the line graphics card and processor and most recent RAM. got it all. AND an OLED screen? love it. gaming has always been a passion of mine, but never actually purchased a dedicated gaming computer. this blows away my expectations. I DO RECOMMEND you purchase a laptop cooling frame that has built in fans to help keep it cool and maximize performance. i bought a $50 one that tilts and it’s a must for maintaining peak performance.",Yes
5,Absolutely savage,"Absolutely top of line. I've never owned a nicer laptop. I mean, this laptop puts some people's custom PC builds to shame. It's an absolute powerhouse. And it's pretty light and compact. It's really easy to travel with and it comes with this awesome case to put it in. Absolutely worth every dollar. And the price at my local Best Buy was actually really affordable. Also, my cat really loved to sit in the packaging.",Yes
2,"Specs Promise, Software Disappoints","I’ve used the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S daily for the past two weeks, and while it has some impressive features on paper, my experience has been underwhelming in key areas — especially when it comes to performance and software control.

⸻

  What I Liked
 • Sleek, modern design: This is hands down the best part. The Helios Neo 16S looks futuristic, premium, and thin for a gaming laptop. It feels like something from 2025 — in a good way.
 • Surprisingly good cooling: Thermals are actually well-managed. Under stress, the laptop stays cool without overheating. Acer did a great job with the cooling system here.

⸻

  What Let Me Down
 • Predator Sense is very limited: Compared to ASUS Armoury Crate or Lenovo Vantage, Acer’s Predator Sense feels outdated. There’s no GPU tuning, no manual overclocking, no advanced fan curve settings — nothing to help squeeze more performance out of the machine.
 • Locked-down GPU: I ran Steal Nomad benchmark multiple times and no matter what I tried (including external apps like MSI Afterburner), I couldn’t unlock better performance. It feels like the GPU (5070 Ti) is locked down by Acer’s firmware or software.
 • Performance issues:
 • I experienced small freezes and glitches, especially when closing games or connecting to my Samsung monitor — things like screen flickering and display kick-backs.
 • What really shocked me: my older Lenovo Legion with a 4060 performed better in RDR2. Smoother gameplay, higher FPS, and just a better experience overall — despite having lower specs on paper.

⸻

  Tech Updates I Tried

I fully updated the system: BIOS, GPU drivers, Windows, Predator Sense — everything. Still, the performance didn’t improve. It feels like the laptop’s full potential is being held back by Acer’s software limits, and that’s a shame given how good the hardware could be.

⸻

Conclusion

The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S looks great and stays cool, but it feels like a sports car with the engine capped. The limitations in software control, locked-down GPU performance, and weird system bugs really took away from the experience. It promises flagship-level specs, but in actual gaming and benchmarking, it underdelivers.

I wanted to love this laptop — and I still think the design and cooling are excellent — but the lack of tuning options and inconsistent performance are deal-breakers for me.",No
5,Great Gaming Computer & Good for College Too,I got this for my son at college who is a computer science major. His 2 in one laptop screen cracked so this is all he has right now to use in class. He likes it a lot. I told him we can get him another 2-in-1 but he said this is working fine for now. I was worried it would be too heavy for him to carry but he is fine carrying it in his school backpack bag.,Yes
4,"Great Performance, Great Screen, A Few Rough Edges","Display:
The display is honestly one of the first things that stands out. The OLED panel looks beautiful and the 240Hz refresh rate makes everything feel very responsive. Colors look rich, details pop, and the overall viewing experience is great whether you are gaming, watching videos, or just browsing.

CPU:
Even though the processor is limited a bit because the laptop is slim, it still performs really well. Getting around 3100 in single core and 20k in multicore on Geekbench 6.

GPU:
The 115w 5070 Ti performs way better than you would expect for its power limit. Games run smoothly on the highest settings. For example, getting around 120fps in Black Myth Wukong on ultra with ray tracing and DLSS is impressive. It can handle modern games without struggling.

Speakers:
The speakers are not great for the price. They sound weak and lack depth. Using a custom profile in FX Sound helps a lot, but out of the box they are underwhelming.

Battery:
Battery life is on the weaker side. The main issue is that the display stays locked at 240Hz even when running on battery. The panel and the drivers support variable refresh rate, but Acer has disabled it. Because of that the battery drains quickly and you will probably end up keeping the charger close most of the time.

Thermals:
With a laptop cooler, turbo mode, and fans at full speed, the temperatures stay pretty controlled. While gaming on ultra settings, the CPU usually sits around 79°C and sometimes spikes up to around 88°. The GPU stays around 77°C. For a slim gaming laptop these temperatures are quite reasonable.

Keyboard and Trackpad:
The keyboard has a comfortable feel. It is not too soft and not too clicky. Typing and gaming both feel good. The trackpad is average. It works fine but there is nothing special about it.

Software:
The Acer Predator software still needs improvement. It can bug out at times. Sometimes the fans get stuck at max speed and the only way to fix it is restarting the laptop. Other times it refuses to change power modes because it thinks the laptop is on battery even though the charger is plugged in. Restarting usually fixes these problems but it does get annoying. Acer definitely needs to polish the app.

My Take:
This laptop gives great value for the price. The performance is strong, the display looks amazing, and it handles games really well. If you can live with the weak speakers and the need to keep the charger around, it is a solid choice that delivers a lot for what you pay.",Yes
5,5 stars for the Best Bang for the Buck,"I need a portable gaming laptop, the price for what you get is phenomenally awesome, thank you ACER! Here are the Pros: 240 OLED not 165 (looks awesome!); Awesome CPU & GPU combo; 32GB RAM at 6400MHz; Slim profile with free sleeve bag; DTX Ultra speakers; Cool software with one touch settings; and the Price at this specs is unbeatable. Now the Cons: Heat- make sure you set the performance or gaming when gaming; 2nd M.2 needs slim heatsink for thermals or put thermal pads to aluminum back; very complicated included software- learning curve needed (just to turn off RGB keyboard, loading predator sound, and BIOS access) and USB-C charging not working- need to use bulky included charger. Overall this is the best laptop at $2K below!",Yes
4,Almost perfect,"I was quite surprised by how good this laptop was. I usually think of bidget materials when it comes to acer laptops, but this one feels very premium. Im honestly amazes at the build quality. The laptoo is a bit wider than normal laptops so i doesnt fit in my bag but thats fine. The cooling is very good to. But to be safe i still got a laptop cooler. The laptoo being at 240hz always isnt a big deal for me, but thats something to keep in mind. It has a lot of ports and i appreciate the SD card slot being there still. The only thing that stopped this from being perfect is the software. I just wish they had something like armory crate and g helper. I would love to set wattage limits on the cpu and gpu and have custom profiles. The software for gaming mods is very barebones and you cant set your own fan curves. But these are not deal breakers. I was gonna purchase a laptop cooler regardless. For it being $1899 this is almost reasonably priced. Everything else is 600$ more. If this ever goes on sale for 1599 or 1699 get it. The software wont be perfect, but the build quality and hardware is incredible. 4.5 stars.",Yes
5,Cheaper and more powerful than Zephyrus G16,"Very pleased with this ""thin and light"" version of the Neo 16. It's about 19mm thick (0.75""). About the same as a Macbook Pro or a Zephyrus G16, although it does have an extra 1"" sticking out the back behind the hinge. GPU performance is comparable to the Zephyrus, but CPU performance in the Neo 16S is about 50% higher, due to the 275HX CPU.

Screen is beautiful, keyboard is a pleasure to type on, with no discernable flex under normal typing. Build quality is excellent. The case does attract fingerprints.

The laptop has a 240Hz display, confirmed in Windows, even though both the inner box and the outer carton says  165Hz display.

Note that the GPU and CPU are slightly power limited by Acer due to the cooling limitations imposed by the slim chassis. So this laptop will be about 10% slower than, say, a Strix or other full-sized laptop. But that's the same tradeoff you'd make with a Zephyrus.

All tests were done in Turbo mode. Click on the links ahd hit Details to see average CPU and GPU temps, etc. 3dMark doesn't display the complete temp graphs from the runs online, but I have them if anyone has questions or wants me to post a graph from a particular test. Temperatures never got out of hand. CPU usually hovered around 100C during the most intense parts of the benchmarks and sometimes hit 103C, but that was rare. Intel allows the CPU to get as hot as 105C before it throttles. It hovers around 60C at idle. So that does eat into battery life. But battery life is comparable to other similarly powered laptops (with same CPU and GPU).

5,Perfect for Gaming,"The only downside to this laptop is that you cannot change the refresh rate on the screen, but as someone who always has it plugged in, it is perfect for me. I use it everyday and have had no issues so far, the GPU can run any game no problem and the AI CPU is a very cool and new feature that I am still getting used to. The AI CPU has helped me a lot with online school and helps me get a better understanding of the topics I read.

4) Build quality is good. (Based on price)
5) Has full keyboard with numpad it helps a lot.

Cons:
1) Battery life is not so good only upto 3 hrs with eco settings.
2) 240 hz is fixed can not be changed.
3) GPU+ CPU is power hungry which cause it to heat a lot.
4) Gets fingerprints.

4,Game-Changer for Power & Portability,"I’ve been gaming and working on the Helios Neo 16S AI for a few weeks, and I’m thoroughly impressed. The 16” 240 Hz OLED display is spectacular—ultra-sharp visuals alongside smooth motion in every game and video. Paired with the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and RTX 5070 Ti, this laptop tackles AAA titles at high settings effortlessly. DLSS 4 is a perfect match for this hardware, boosting performance without sacrificing quality.  

What really stands out is the build. At just under 19 mm thin, yet equipped with robust cooling (liquid metal + fifth‑gen AeroBlade 3D fans), it stays impressively cool even during intense gaming sessions. Ports are smartly positioned—Thunderbolt 4, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, microSD, and USB-A/C are abundant, so no need for dongles. ()

Battery life? Great for light use—up to 6½ hours of video playback—but naturally, gaming drains it fast. Fans get audible under load, but it’s a trade-off for the raw power packed inside. ()

If you’re hunting for a desktop-replacement gaming laptop that blends performance, visuals, and thoughtful design, this is it. It’s bold, gamer-focused, and delivers exactly what the specs promise.
 • Display & Visuals: 16” WQXGA OLED, 240 Hz, 1 ms response—tilts modern gaming visuals into cinematic territory.
 • Performance: Core Ultra 9 275HX + RTX 5070 Ti = buttery smooth gameplay with DLSS 4 enabled.
 • Thermals & Build: Axiom-level cooling, solid aluminum-chassis feel, and sturdy construction.
 • Connectivity: One of the best-equipped mid‑size laptops with full Thunderbolt, HDMI, Ethernet, USB-A/C, and card reader.
 • Drawbacks: Heavier than ultralights (~2.3 kg/5 lb), fans audible under load, battery life limited during gaming.

An excellent balance of powerful hardware, stunning OLED visuals, and premium build, making it a top-tier gaming pick. Ideal for gamers, creators, and power users who value performance-first laptops—even at the cost of some weight and battery runtime.",Yes
5,Acer Predator,"Great specs and build quality for the price. You can't beat the processor and graphics for this price. Only drawbacks is that this laptop gets HOT and LOUD. You can put it in eco or silent mode and fix those issues, but gaming or modeling will definitely heat it up.",Yes
5,Impressed,"Pros:
Absolutely stunning 16"" 240Hz OLED display with perfect blacks and vibrant color.
Excellent gaming performance from the Core Ultra 9 and RTX 5070 Ti.
Highly competitive price for the level of hardware included.
Sleek, understated design for a gaming laptop.
Comfortable keyboard with a number pad.
Cons:
Keyboard deck and chassis get very hot under load.
Fans can be extremely loud during gaming.
Poor battery life.
Underwhelming speakers and a cheap-feeling trackpad.",Yes
5,Amazing Machine with almost Zero compromises!!,"So after a couple of months of going back & forth between buying & returning gaming laptops, some for actual software or hardware issues and a couple of them just because I didn't end up liking for often several reasons, i have finally landed here!! I could probably write pages on the likes and dislikes amoungst the other laptops I've tried in comparison to this one but it would take entirely too long. I'll just say finally a gaming laptop that has everything i was looking for plus some. Features a OLED beautiful & bright display, It says 165hz display in the description but when i went into the display settings, it actually shows running at 240hz for the refresh rate... Which is a bonus!!... It goes over 300 nits for the display brightness, has 32gb Ram, 1 tb storage, RTX 5070ti, with an Ultra 9 series 2 processor or the 275HX variant. Plus has a premium feel build quality, full keyboard & a slim sleek design!. Also I cant forget to mention the great port selection it has in comparison to the others ive tried......I've paid more for other ""comparable"" gaming laptops... Alienware, MSI,Asus, older predators....just to name a couple lol...but they always came with some kind of compromise whether it be the screen quality/resolution or a lower processor or a lower overall nit brightness or only 16gb of ram or a lesser gpu or poorer port selection or combos of. I suppose there really is no ""perfect"" gaming laptop but this one just packs it all! Definitely recommend over the new Asus Rog Strix G16 with the FHD display which also happens to be more expensive (at the time of this review) if display immersion is your thing. Along with a recommendation over the MSI Stealth A16 AI (Amazing build & display, but had to return for what came to be a known glitching screen issue for that model). The Asus was the last laptop i had before exchanging it for this one and im glad i decided to exchange it.... Acer is killing the game with this one and for the price point in comparison to some of the others (at the time of this review), it is an all around, more complete & excellent package without all the compromises!",Yes
5,A True High-End Gaming Beast!,"The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI Gaming Laptop is an absolute powerhouse, and easily one of the best purchases I’ve made for both gaming and productivity. For the price, you’re getting top-tier hardware and cutting-edge features that truly rival much more expensive models.

Performance

Powered by the Intel Core Ultra 9 and paired with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, this laptop breezes through demanding AAA games, content creation tasks, and AI-assisted workloads.

The 32GB RAM ensures seamless multitasking — you can run multiple heavy applications without a hitch.

Display

The 16” OLED display at 240Hz is nothing short of stunning. The colors are vibrant, blacks are true black, and the high refresh rate makes everything from gaming to scrolling through content feel buttery smooth. It’s easily one of the best displays I’ve seen on a gaming laptop in this price range.

AI Features

The integrated AI enhancements really elevate the experience. From intelligent performance tuning to real-time background noise suppression, Acer’s AI integration makes a tangible difference in both gaming and productivity scenarios.

Cooling and Build

Thermals are handled very well, thanks to Acer's advanced cooling system. Even under load, the laptop remains relatively cool and quiet. The Obsidian Black chassis looks sleek, modern, and feels solidly built — it definitely has a premium feel.

Storage & Connectivity

With a 1TB SSD, you have plenty of ultra-fast storage for games and files. Load times are nearly instant. You also get a full suite of ports, including Thunderbolt and HDMI, which is perfect for multi-monitor setups or external accessories.

Final Verdict:
If you're looking for a high-end gaming laptop that delivers premium performance, display quality, and AI enhancements, the Predator Helios Neo 16S is hard to beat — especially at this price point. Acer has nailed the balance of power, aesthetics, and value here. Whether you're a hardcore gamer, creative professional, or power user, this machine is built to impress.

Highly recommended!",Yes
4,Acer predator Helios Neo 16S,This product has beautiful displays and runs software quickly and efficiently. The problems with it include over heating and a short battery life. This is not a big issue for me though because I can keep it plugged in during use.,Yes
4,Pretty good laptop,"Laptop is bery powerful and has plenty of over head with the 5070ti and 32gb of ram. It performs very well and the predator app works pretty well with the switches on the laptop. I feel like if the charger was a 280w the 5070ti might pish more permance. The OLED screen is beautiful and petsomally the best part of the laptop. Worst thing is the intel chip runs HOT even whike idling or browsing thr web it stays at around 65-75c and when gaming it will get up 85-100c and that is with riser and an ambient room temp of around 72f, i feel like if i would of went with an AMD chip it would of been better. Overall great laptop and performs like i want to and need.",Yes
5,Amazing laptop,"Extremely good laptop, it’s powerful and doesn’t overheat much. Since it’s a gaming laptop, don’t expect to last very long on battery, and to get its full performance you will need to play plugged in. But it’s for gaming, not office work, and it’s a total beast with gaming, and it has a beautiful screen and really good keyboard. At this price range it is definitely the best gaming laptop you can get.",Yes
5,"Powerhouse ""budget"" laptop","The performance on the laptop is like nothing I've experienced on a laptop.  When you couple the raw performance with DLSS 4, its just crazy.  The screen is gorgeous and I'll never get another laptop without an OLED display, its that good.

I've had a couple games crash on me randomly....not really a crash but they started to stutter really bad.  It was fixed by restarting the game and doesn't seem to be a pattern.  Hoping its not a heat issue.  Speaking about heat, with the fans a full speed, this thing is LOUD.  As long as there is no overheating issue, this thing is gold - especially at this price point.",Yes
5,"Amazing display, quality, performance & thermal","Love that sleek and understated look that just look and feels premium.  It's thin and packs a HX processor, which was a surprise considering the thickness.  The thermals is amazing. (This is my second gaming notebook that I've bought this year for me and my kid, and it is far better than the one that cost over $1k more of the same GPU/CPU, and significantly thicker in March with pre-order).  

I'm also glad that I didn't see earlier reviews, otherwise, I would've bought at the full MSRP, which is  a great value at MSRP especially compare to its nearest comp.  Yes, it would be a steal at full MSRP.  My complaint is that my nearest Best Buy was out of stock earlier this year when I was ready to buy.  

The display is incredibly vivid, with ultra high color gamut, and 240Hz matches perfectly with the RTX5070Ti GPU.  

Even on the smaller things in life like Thunderbolt and Type C, I really appreciate that Acer enabled one of the Type C with direct dGPU connection.  My other gaming notebook from Best Buy had both connected to iGPU (hated it).  

I do play mostly on external displays, and appreciate the dGPU Type C and Power is on the back, and makes the cable management clean.
  

The built quality is great, but what really made me happy was that I got far far far more performance than other thin chassis that cost much more.  My only regret was that I wish Best Buy would've had this unit much earlier.  Could've saved me a few thousand dollars from my first RTX5070Ti that I bought before reviews existed (different brand).  

Battery life, yes, it is a gaming notebook, and I have no issues with it.  

Overall, this is the best gaming notebook that I had purchased and love the performance, display, and quality of this product.",Yes
5,Awesome !,"The Acer Predator Helios 16 is a powerhouse designed for gamers, creators, and professionals who demand top-tier performance from a portable machine. With the 2024 version, Acer brings updated internals, advanced cooling, and a stunning Mini LED display to the forefront.

Pros:

Blazing Performance: With up to an Intel Core i9-13980HX CPU and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080, it chews through AAA games and creative workloads effortlessly.

Beautiful Display: The 16-inch Mini LED panel (WQXGA, 240Hz) is vivid and bright, with excellent HDR support and color accuracy.

Improved Cooling: Acer’s dual-fan cooling system with liquid metal thermal grease keeps the laptop cool during heavy loads.

Solid Build: A refreshed chassis design with a premium, matte finish gives the laptop a sleek yet aggressive look.

Customizable RGB Keyboard: Per-key",Yes
5,Best Gaming Laptop I ever Had!,"I'm absolutely blown away by this laptop! The performance is insane, and the graphics are stunning. I've played some of the most demanding games on the market, and this laptop handles them with ease. The display is gorgeous, and the keyboard is comfortable to type on. The battery life is better than expected, and the design is sleek and portable. I've had zero issues with overheating or lag. This laptop is a beast! Highly recommend to any serious gamer out there.

*Pros:*

- Exceptional performance
- Stunning display
- Comfortable keyboard
- Good battery life
- Sleek design

*Would I buy again?* Absolutely!",Yes
5,FAST and lightweight.,This laptop is FAST! I use it for flight simulation with no issues at all. Many ports and it’s lightweight. I also use it for programming and have not had any issues with office applications.Time will tell if this was a great purchase for about $1500.00.,Yes
4,"Powerful laptop, but needs some tweaking","I bought the Acer Predator Helios with Intel Ultra 9 and RTX 5070 Ti. Gaming performance is excellent, the screen is bright with good colors, and cooling handles long sessions well. However, I noticed that the CPU sometimes spikes up to 105°C for a few seconds when a workload starts, then it quickly drops back to normal and stays stable. On my previous ASUS laptop with Ryzen, I never had those temperature jumps.

Out of the box, the system also comes with a lot of preinstalled software, which slows down startup. After cleaning the bloatware and adjusting the startup apps, the laptop now runs fast and smooth — but the first impression wasn’t perfect.

Pros:

Strong CPU and GPU performance

Good display quality

Decent cooling once it ramps up

Solid build and design


Cons:

Short CPU temperature spikes up to 105°C

Too much preinstalled software

Needs optimization out of the box


Bottom line: If you don’t mind doing a bit of cleanup and tweaking, this is a very capable gaming laptop with excellent performance",Yes
2,Black acreen (bsod) and freeze restarting,"This product, while having a beautiful display and steong gpu, absolutely loves to lock itself. Black screens where it wont turn them on yet the keyboard is lighting up like when it restarts. Often hangs itself like that where you have to force restart it. After closing a game or a few minutes in, will crash without a bsod and restart itself. It's decently weighty as well, so not exactly great for a laptop on the go but good if you travel snd plan to keep it set in specific places for extended periods of time. Not for college or always on the go per say. It has power and the fans can get loud. Max fan is around 6-7k which is like a roar. Multiple gaming profiles to set up auto-scenrio for apps, like gaming and having specific apps like Cod set beneath it. Battery life is terrible. Even with no games going, setting the energy saver mode with all its recs, maybe 3-4 hours for basic processes. They keyboard is nice and the predator app isnt bad. The keyboard gets really hot just from idiling around the asd keys and more so around l,p keys.  Sound is decent, mostly loud when on startup due to the booting and logo unskippable cutscene.",No
4,Good laptop,"A very powerful laptop, great screen, and it's good for a student. The battery is the weakest point and it's kind of noisy, but I will recommend it for sure as a great, reliable laptop.",Yes
3,"Great Deal, Mid-Range Performance","Don’t get me wrong — this laptop is super powerful, and you don’t have to worry about whether it’ll run next-gen games. The price is insanely good (I got mine for $999).

That said, performance-wise, it’s only around the level of an RTX 5060 Ti — which isn’t bad, but considering that a desktop 5060 Ti costs way less, it’s a bit disappointing. You can unlock undervolting to squeeze out a bit more performance and improve heat management, but it takes some tweaking and isn’t straightforward for everyone.

Other downsides include the screen being locked at 240 Hz, the battery lasting around four hours or less depending on what you’re doing, and formatting? Forget it. The BIOS has VMD enabled — and the worst part? It’s hidden. You’ll need to go into the BIOS and press Ctrl + S to deactivate it.

Fan and heat management could definitely be better out of the box, but honestly, you get what you pay for. As for the speakers… I could probably buy better ones on SHEIN or AliExpress.

Overall, I’m not complaining — it’s been a great deal from the start, and I don’t plan on changing laptops for the next 5–8 years. Final score: 7/10.",No
5,Love my new laptop!,"Coming at this review as a pretty casual consumer who uses this laptop mainly for indies, cozy games, and Fortnite- this thing is a beast. My old desktop doesn’t come close to this laptop’s performance and the screen is gorgeous. I only use it plugged in on a flat surface so I can’t really speak to battery life or even heat management, but I’ve never noticed super loud fans or it being hot to the touch. For the price, this thing is amazing and I have no regrets.",Yes
5,Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI,"This laptop works very well for both gaming and daily tasks. The screen quality is bright and sharp, the performance is fast, and the design feels premium. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.",Yes
5,"High-End Gaming Laptop: A Value for Money, But..","This high-end gaming laptop offers an exceptional value for money. However, it is crucial to exercise caution when folding the laptop while it is powered on. I encountered an issue where the screen became blocked out upon folding it back open, causing the laptop’s fans to accelerate and generate excessive heat. Fortunately, this incident occurred only once, and I was able to turn off the laptop after it had drained its battery. It is possible that this was a temporary glitch, or perhaps it is advisable to avoid turning on the laptop when it has only 10% battery remaining.",Yes
3,Best Review,"This laptop is a great desktop replacement. This laptop is not easy to carry around. This laptop is designed for young gen and not older gen adults. This laptop does look like a gaming laptop. This laptop is of great quality.  After all updates and refreshes the laptop was very snappy and fast in general. This laptop is upgradable. Graphics are sweet and its just nice to play games, not movies in my opinion. Its still pricey but if you have no desktop, no laptop and have 2k budget it could easily be your main device if you are into gaming and stuff like that.",Yes
5,Few compromises,Got it and currently testing this. Can’t beat price to performance. Max wattage is 115. Capped at 240Hz plugged or unplugged. Screen is glossy which I’m not a big fan of but man do the colors look good. It’s thinner than my previous laptop. I keep my laptops plugged so the battery life is not an issue for me.,Yes
5,So far I loved it,"So far, this is an excellent Laptop. The price is almost the same as other products of the same specifications has. Immediately I put my Steam account and downloaded my favorite games, I was shock whit the quality in the graphics and the jump from my previous PC in comparation when I played, no lag, more fast loading and incredible I began to put all at fantastic. The only thing I think is not good is that of course it is more powerful and heat up more quickly and the fan at max level is loud. In my case I live in Florida so it is very hot outside so I do not recommend using it outdoors.",Yes
4,Great specs,"On paper the specs for the price is fantastic, beautiful OLED screen and 12gb 5070Ti along with a sufficient 32gb ram for under $2k is great. It's much slimmer and lighter than the non-S Neo16, both the laptop itself and the power brick. 

Downsides: refresh rate of the monitor is locked at 240 Hz so power consumption even doing web browsing or word processing type tasks is poor. Really wish they would give the option or automatically toggle to 60hz while on the igpu. Secondly, the power brick connections are bad. I went through 2 Helio Neos both with the same issue. At least the connector on the back of the Slim version clicks in more securely than the non-slim version. But both were touchy and would require unplug/replug at least half the time I turn on the laptop. I think with how great the specs are, Acer couldn't cut costs on things like the GPU or processor, so unquantifiable things like the charging cord is where they found ways to cut costs, unfortunately. Hopefully even with the annoyance of unplugging and replugging and making sure not to touch the power cord, it'll keep working as long as expected.

Temperatures aren't bad, I stay under 75°C while gaming even without a fan dock.",Yes
5,Absolutely no regrets,"Bought this for my son for school and gaming (mostly gaming, not going to lie, but he does do his homework on it) and I am extremely jealous. The graphics and processing speed and insane. This powerhouse of a laptop is an absolute workhorse and can play any game. It is worth the price tag.",Yes
5,Pretty good.,Fairly powerful. Bought at a discount. Slim. Good display. May run hot.,Yes
5,This thing rips!,"The Bees Kneez. Nothing else comes close to the price. The performance for a laptop is insane. The fans are loud, but they keep this thing extremely cool for a gaming laptop with this much power. At first listen, the speakers are absolute K9 excrement, but once i turn of the sound effects and equalizers and used them plainly, they were ok, still the worst performing component.",Yes
5,Great machine,"The hardware works great, there was minimal bloatware that I was able to uninstall easily, still plays decent when not plugged in. While plugged in it plays very well and keeps itself cool without being too loud even if displaying to a 4K TV",Yes
5,"OLED stunning, 5070TI impressive","Shockingly sharp display I though 1440p on a 16"" would be overkill but perhaps combined with OLED it really mesmerized me.  Long time fan of 1080p I was worried the extra pixels would hurt performance but the 5070TI is letting me max out all settings no issues.  I only wish it came with a 2TB drive instead of 1TB but not storing lots of movies it seems fine.",Yes
5,Love It!!,"This is an awesome laptop.  The look and feel of the outside, the buttons, the OLED screen.  The performance of the GPU, frame rates and resolution is outstanding.  My first gaming laptop coming from XBOX series X.  Purchased so I can game outside of just my house.",Yes
4,Acer Predator Helios Neos 16s,Good laptop overall. I was between the legion 7i and this one. I got the acer just because it had better specs. Yes it has some problems like not being able to change the Hz and overheating sometime but I think it’s worth it for the price.,Yes
5,First gaming laptop and I’m obsessed,"Runs so smooth,  colors are so vibrant and all of my games run so well.  The design is super cool and sleek I also love the charging port placement in the back so wherever you choose to set up you won’t have any problems with the cord.",Yes
5,Worth it,So far this laptop has been a beast.  It has handled anything I’ve thrown at it so far with no issues and being able to adjust the fan speed makes it a breeze to keep cool.  The battery life is the only Achilles heel of this product but what do you expect with this much performance jam packed into a small product.,Yes
5,Outstanding gamer laptop,"Very thinn and fast computer. Waited for long time to be available in stock. GREAT EQUIPMENT, several games installed - screen is abosolutely high definition. I can run fortnite with 1980 X 1080 with 250 FPS. with 2550 at 144 FPS. COD and other games have ridiculous high FPS rates. buy it! You can control the laptop bevahiour using the predator sense APP, so i changed easly from working mode to gamer mode (turbo).",Yes
5,Great Performance,"This pc is a beast. As it can be seen from its specs, it has a really high performance. However, it can be out of charge quickly when compared to other alternatives such as a macbook. Other than that  I couldn@t have asked for a better computer.",Yes
5,Greay gaming laptop,"Screen looks amazing. So far im playing Diablo 4, Monster Hunter Wilds, Helldivers 2 and Marvel's Rivals and they run smooth with over 150FPS on max settings. Be sure to put brightnes to max level and play with the settings to take advantage of the OLED display.
Performance mode is ok and turbo mode is kind of loud. But the speakers make up for it. Pretty great laptop specially for the price.",Yes
3,"Performance King, Quality Control Gamble","Performance wise this thing is a beast. Unfortunately, there is a bit of a lottery. I was having significant overheating issues. There were times my CPU hits 70C-80C watching YouTube videos which is not normal. Fortunately for me I am able to open a laptop pretty comfortably and diagnose. The liquid metal from the factory was pretty much non-existent. I had to add a couple drops and re-applicate. If you know what you're doing, this laptop is definitely for you. But if you're expecting to just plug it in without any issues, you may want to reconsider.",Yes
4,Good laptop,Good performance gets a little hot on the bottom of the computer,Yes
4,Great computer,"It’s a great computer. The only things I would comment negatively on is the built in speakers, they don’t have the greatest quality that I feel a computer for this price should have. The fans can be a bit loud, but that’s typical for gaming computers. The screen is beautiful!",Yes
4,Acer predator,"Its a nice laptop, graphics is good but one thing i hate is it heat up so fast.",No
5,Was cautious but very pleased. Solid!,"Was nervous about quality for this price but this laptop is fantastic.  Great build quality.  Mine sits on a cooling bad so the laptop fans never really turn on.  The cooling design of open grates on the bottom works super well.  This laptop does not get hot like previous i7-14 and under series.
It's better than I expected.",Yes
5,great cost-benefit,"Excellent equipment, great value for money.
It's relatively noisy, but the quality is very good. I'm from Brazil, I bought it on a trip, and the price was much better than buying it in my country.",Yes
5,Exceptional Computer and Great Service,"The laptop runs my games perfectly!!  My sales person, Cody, did an amazing job on recognising my needs for a quality but not top shelf laptop.  He searched for a couple minutes to find the correct laptop as a few had the same SKU but not the same specs.  This laptop runs Doom The Dark Ages no problems.  Diablo 4 looks even better than it did on my Windows 10 PC.  Only downfall, which comes with any store bought PC, is all the extra crap the MFG puts on.  Acer software, demo software of McAffee.  I'd rather have that stripped off and let me do what I want...",Yes
5,Great in Windows AND Linux.,"Excellent value especially at the sales price. Nothing comes close to the spec for the money you spend.

This laptop isn’t “fancy”, or even “sleek”. It’s a throwback to big beastly gaming laptops, with a focus on retaining some semblance of thin-ness.

I am using this as a dev workstation, so it’s now running Ubuntu. If you go this route, there will be challenges, for example I still can’t change the rgb for the keyboard. Obviously not the laptops fault, everything is flawless in the default windows install.

I am running LLM’s up to ~14b at ~45 t/s, and creating agents using much lighter models to perform simple tasks. Those run in the hundreds of t/s.",Yes
5,BUY IT! ...before it sells out!,"I have a 17-year-old grandson who can run circles around anyone when it comes to technology. Well, I asked him a couple weeks ago what he might like for Christmas this year and he said he had been researching laptops for weeks, trying to find the one that would support everything he does. Between school and his job, he needs the absolute best and had been saving his money to get this one because ""it’s light years better than everything else!” So, of course I bought it. He is beyond happy with the results. He said it has exceeded his wildest expectations!  Yay Grandma!",Yes
2,Amazing but…,"On paper this Laptop is amazing! Best Buy did an awesome job by listing this product. It was sold out everywhere. I was extremely lucky they had one on display at the best buy near me and so I was able to order one at the store, even though it was sold out. The screen is spectacular. It’s been only a week and the laptop is already shutting down 45 min into my gaming sessions. I purchased the laptop to play video games. I travel for work and on my down time I love to game. I checked the event log on windows and it seems the laptop over throttles and shuts down to prevent damage. I was looking at the cpu temperatures while in game and the temp was fluctuating from 80 to 100 degrees Celsius within seconds. I’m not sure if this is a hardware issue or software malfunction when reading temps. I called acer and they had me update the BIOS but still shut down. I really love this laptop but I think I have no choice but to return it. I hope they can fix the issue.",Yes
5,Bang for the buck,Great thin and light powerhouse of a laptop. And for the price is an amazing deal,Yes
5,Amazing for gaming,Best laptop I’ve owned. Definitely recommend getting a cooling pad for it. Oled screen with the 5070ti goes hard,Yes
5,Great laptop!,This laptop has been a great purchase! I love how fast it is and the screen images are sharp and clear! I am so glad we purchased this one.,Yes
5,Review,It's a pretty good laptop with a powerful graphic chard with a smoth screen i ever seen,Yes
5,Excelent,"Excelent laptop, fast, powerfull and very good screen",Yes
5,Great,"great mix of budget, performance and portability. Covers all areas realy well",Yes
5,As advertized!,"Beautifl and sleek machine, runs great, does tend to get a bit warm during heavy gaming sessions though.",Yes
4,Fantastic except for 1 thing,"Laptop is great.  Everything loads fast, graphics are superb.  Using copilot with alt-enter is a breeze and the bread and butter of interacting these days.  Only thing that cracked me up laughing, was the audio.  Maybe I was spoiled before with my custom laptop, but the sound coming out of this thing is like a tin can.  Absolutely wretched haha.  Definitely dont get this laptop unless you already have some good headphones, or external speakers.",Yes
4,Miss control key on right side,"Great product, it's better than I expected, the games run well and without lowering the quality, very fast and efficient. The only bad thing is that where it should have the control key on the right side, it has an AI button and in my case I need that key as a control, it's very difficult for me to press the left control.",Yes
3,Is really amazing laptop but,"Specs insane, performance really good but something happen sometimes im trying to fix it but i cant, sometimes the picture frozen and you can hear everything working except for the picture frozen the only way to fix is hold the power and shut off and restart….  I was trying to play world of warcraft just world of warcraft nothing AAA, before this laptop im using zephyros  16” version 2022 I bought from best buy too.  Im trying to exchange for another one but the store no have more here only the money back and my store start burning  that is really sad. Rainbow arroyo.",Yes
5,The best laptop !,"I see a lot of people worrying about benchmarks and trying to choose the best purchase, but I can tell you with confidence this is the best you can buy for the price. Its screen is incredible! I had never had an OLED other than on cell phones, and it’s so amazing that I’m even thinking about getting an OLED monitor as well. As for Best Buy’s service, it was top-notch when I bought it! I totally recommend it.",Yes
5,This Acer Predator is a beast!,"I recently purchased this laptop as I needed something under a certain price but with a higher end 50xx series Nvidia for video editing and gaming. I am very happy with my purchase as this Acer Predator is fast to boot up, has a nice RGB keyboard, works well with Adobe and Topaz apps and fits all my gaming needs. 

I keep it plugged in because it would drain too fast for what I do but I am always near a socket so it isn't an issue for me.",Yes
5,Amazing laptop,Amazing laptop for the price. 5070ti delivers. Only upgrade needed is the ssd. The only thing I dislike is the speakers. But other than that the laptop is amazing and I love the backlight on the cover. This is by far my favorite laptop I’ve owned.,Yes
5,The Price is Right!,"At the time of writing, this laptop easily beats other laptops with similar specs on price-point. If it ever goes on sale, it will be a steal. Almost all other 5070 TI laptops are well over $2K with only 16gb of RAM! This one has 32gb and a Core Ultra 9 Series 2 processor at sub $2K price. The OLED panel is beautiful with its inky blacks at 240hz. Buy while it's available.",Yes
5,Nothing comes close at the price!,"Nothing else comes close for the price. Intel Ultra 9 + 507ti, 2 Ram slots. 2 NVME slots. 240Hz OLED display. Well worth the purchase.",Yes
5,Professional power in a laptop,"This laptop has been well able to run architecture software such as Revit, for example,  but is still portable without sacrificing too much screen size and processing power.  It accomodates extra screens with the wealth of ports included.",Yes
5,Working better than expected,"After using it for a week i been loving it, the computer will work with either the cpu or the gpu graphics to manage more battery and when you need more performance it will change in between, so far its been great for all ive thrown to it",Yes
4,Mobile gaming,Works great for what i need which is gaming well out of town on work trips,Yes
4,Best out there for the money!!!,"1st off the speakers are not that bad if you get Dolby Atmos and tune then properly...The fans are only loud under intense gaming ""Performance mode"" which earphones would mostly be used. My only minor gripes would be the glossy screen and no choices on what HZ to run the screen at?",Yes
5,Great Laptop!,"I had a 9-year-old MSI laptop that I needed to replace because Windows was no longer supported. Over time, it had become so slow that it was frustrating to use. My goal was to find an affordable yet powerful laptop to take its place.
After talking with some of my coworkers who are front-end developers, the decision was easy—I went with this one. You simply can’t get these specs for this price from any other brand.
So far, it’s incredibly fast, and multitasking is a breeze. The screen isn’t matte, but the graphics are stunning.
If you’re on the fence, just buy it!",Yes
5,Solid,This was a solid buy. There was another review that said the noise when starting up was annoying. There is a way to remove that sound. You may want to because it is a bit loud.,Yes
5,One of the Best Gaming Laptop,Fast and reliable. Not going to lie the battery does die fast while gaming. So keep it plugged,Yes
5,Great production. quality price amazing,"great, nothing to say about it. the screen its amazing, great contrast and with the fan at maximum you nca play bf6 without have the laptop become a BBQ",Yes
4,Great specs for under 2k,Excellent laptop for price and easy to upgrade SSD (if you have a Torx screwdriver and pry tool) but heats up quickly and does not have any option to set the fan curve.,Yes
5,Fast and bright,"Fast, great screen, stays cool. Works perfectly for complex music production. Will also be doing video production. The Nvidi card should be great for that.",Yes
5,Acer laptop,"For $1700 (sale at the time), im enjoying it. Yes, the audio sucks and the fans are a little loud. You're probably going to wear heaphones to game anyways either at home or wherever. Everything else about this laptop checks all my boxes.",Yes
5,Love it,Great value. High framrates on the games I play. Works best in performance or Turbo mode because that allows the cooling fans to run at higher speeds. Full keyboard is great for software development and processor compiles my code in no time.,Yes
5,Acer - Predator Helios Neo 16S AI Gaming Laptop,Great laptop. Son is delighted. Plays his favorite games at maximum settings. And it seems this is not the limit. We use a month flight normal.,Yes
5,would recommend,"Great laptop, amazing specs, works really fast. the only drawback is the speaker",Yes
5,Great choices,"Great productivity for very reasonable price!
The screen is outstanding!
Like a ports architecture!",Yes
5,Bang for buck,"Absolute bang for buck, only issue is that you cannot lower down the refresh rate on this computer and the battery life sucks so e reviews say it can only last you for 3 hrs max but for me it only last 2 at the very best conditions still really good though",Yes
5,Best value for your money,"I was in the market for a gaming laptop for some time, and this one gave me everything I wanted for the price I wanted to pay.",Yes
2,Not built to last,"Upon powering on and clean installing windows, CPU is consistently sitting idle at 80 degrees with occasional drops to 70 at its lowest. Already sceptical I started Hades maxed out, not a very demanding game. Fans started blasting twenty minutes in and computer completely shut down due to heat. I mean it could be just the one i tried, possible thermal pasting/pipes issue. Or it could be that “too good to be true” still stands true. They obviously cut corners somwhere, and i think i know where.",No
3,Acer helio neos 16s,"It’s a really good computer, talking about , performance, game and screen quality on the laptop. Already exchange the laptop for the same one cause the last one was coming with a processor issue Code 41.  Pretty much the processor/ram was crashing and the computer was Turing off/on every 20 minutes was really annoying. I’m texting this one rright and everything is looking great",Yes
5,Predator,This PC is amazing I don't regret investing my money in it,Yes
5,Vaue for money,"It's a beast laptop, with 240 Hz display. Games run really smooth with no lag.",Yes
5,Bang for your $,"Solid purchase for your money.  The 5070ti, 32 ram, and 1 TB are a solid entry level into current titles.",Yes
5,Great Lapper,So far so good. Runs really well for work related purposes. I haven't had to wait on it for anything.,Yes
5,Great computer excellent price,"So far so good, likely more computer than i need but got it at a great price.",Yes
5,Amazing Labtop for the price,Runs BF 2042 max setttings 1600p ult 140fps it can handle any game you throw wat it max the fan speeds an labtop cooling pad an cpu 78c Gpu 60C well worth the price,Yes

4,Good stuff,Works great i got it for gaming and is better than expected.,No
4,Great machine and sleek,"Great machine, great screen and very fast, any game I okay was running beautifully, I believe the speakers could have been better",Yes

5,Computer,Good and nice computer nice price and excellent services,Yes
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this computer less than 2 months ago. Three days after it arrived, it suddenly shut down (like if from overheating). It was quite strange, it is a very powerful gaming laptop, RTX 5070Ti, I was playing Dragon's Dogma 2 and not in ultra quality and always with the fps and temperature on the screen. It shut off with no warnings, no errors, just pump! No lights or anything. I had to unplug the charger to get it working again. The next day I did a little research and updated the BIOS from the official website to the latest version, and no more problems until now, one month after the last problem, playing Red Dead Redemption 2 I just had the same problem as before. A sudden shutdown. This time, I heard the fan go very loud even though temperatures were below 68°C.  The fan becomes very powerful when temperatures are below 68°C. I had to disconnect the charger again in order to restart the PC . Right now, it's a very difficult situation because the return period has already expired and the product is defective. Furthermore, the BIOS is locked.",No
5,Nothing less than a 5 star,"Great product, it works flawlessly as expected. It has a great performance",Yes
5,great laptop,"great laptop, sent to college campus with fast shipping,",Yes
5,Good Gaming Rig,"The lap top is fast and responsive, the fan is a bit loud but overall I am happy with its performance.",Yes
5,Acer Laptop,Works very good for all kinds of work but works especially good for games,Yes
5,Nice laptop,"Great laptop, nice oled screen. Cant get a better deal on a 5070ti",Yes
5,Acer predator,"Great performance and cost.
Window11 suck by the way.
GPU switch may cause delay and screen black a little bit.",Yes
5,Very good laptop.,"Amazing laptop, the screen colors are brilliant and the speed is very fast. I love it. This laptop will be with me for a long time.",Yes
5,PERFECT,"PErfect gaming laptop for below 2000, has everything you need.",Yes
5,Great laptop! Awesome at running games!,"Performance is awesome for games when connected to charger, I knew that when I made the purchase so it’s been exceeding all expectation!",Yes
5,Best value for a powerful laptop,"Needed something for travel that was powerful and compact,this checks all boxes.",Yes
5,Laptop,"Best laptop ever i have buying into my life, i will recommend everyone that model and also best way payments",Yes
3,Reboots randomly under the load.,"Overall good, but in case of any load rebooted randomly a few times a day. Ended returning it and chose different laptop.
Battery life is very short, which you should expect from gaming laptop, but new laptop I got instead of this one holds battery at least twice as long",No
3,Great when it works. Shuts down at least weekly,"Beautiful looking computer and feels solid.  However, it shuts down randomly (on a weekly basis) with the blue screen error ""Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart"" - normally there will be a code at the very bottom from what I see online- but there is no stop code shown.  Drivers and all software/hardware is up to date.  
One other issue I have is the ""Co-Pilot"" button placement.    It took the space of the Ctrl button that I used frequently. (Not the left Ctrl button)   Would be great if they placed it somewhere else.",No
5,Great!!!,"Does the job for gaming for WOW & Call of duty, and normal use and work",Yes
5,Good laptop,"Exceptionally good screen, runs any game, would recommend",Yes
1,Last time purchasing a Predator Laptop,"I ended up returning this laptop after less than a week of purchase as the screen was stuttering heavily on even basic games, the fans ran loud, and it was overheating constantly.",No
5,Great Acer.,"Very fast, excellent screen, games run great abd look great. Perfect machine.",Yes
5,Excellent quality,"Love the laptop, its everything and more! Its lightweight",Yes
5,Review,Quick response when downloading; fast response to searches on internet and internet sites; speed; color is fantastic;,Yes
4,Review,"It is a good system, but the AI is a little jumpy.  Cuts in and out however it really helped when I had to send an important letter",Yes
4,"Good Buy, expect it to last a long time","Great view and easy to set up.  The keyboard layout is a little non standard, so that takes some getting use to.",Yes
5,Work Great!,No issues so far. I bought this about a month ago and it can handel all of my PC games i have been wantung to play. A great computer for a furst time gamer and a lot cheaper than some other options out there.,Yes
5,Title,Good laptop heats up fast tho. Specs are very nice,Yes
1,"Not great, even for the low price. Don’t buy.","Besides from the abysmal battery life, overclocking and undervolting lock, and terrible speakers, Acer had driver issues as well. Opening Steam would probably give an epilepsy for some, specifically on a game page or your friends list. Very low power 5070ti, you might as well get a 5070 and overclock it if you are okay with missing out of 4g VRAM. Additionally, in the first week of purchase, i got 2 BSODs and many, MANY stuttering errors.

I don’t have the product video (it was on the laptop), but I do have a video of the Steam situation here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLaptops/comments/1n8uxhp/moving_away_from_acer/",No
5,Buy Yes,Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood,Yes
5,Great experience,Gavin was extremely helpful and did a great job assisting me and my son purchasing a laptop. Phenomenal associate!,Yes
1,Very Disappointed with Delivery Experience,"I purchased the Acer Helios Neo 16S laptop for nearly $1,800 along with Best Buy’s Total Premium Membership (another $180), which promises 2-day delivery. I placed my order on September 4, and the system showed a delivery date of September 8. I stayed home the entire day, rearranging my schedule to receive the package, but it never arrived.

For such a high-value purchase, this experience has been extremely frustrating. The product itself may be great, but Best Buy needs to deliver on its promises — especially when customers pay extra for premium services. I expected reliability, and instead I feel let down.",No
5,Best for the value,"Best for the Value, and the way we could price match is the best thing.",Yes
4,Not too too bad,"Its about average………………………………………………………..
…………………….",Yes
5,For Gaming,The laptop is amazing it hasnt given me any problems wit atleast 3 months of moderate use it is reliable and i can run any game i want at good settings.,Yes
5,He's just gorgeous.,There are no disadvantages. I have been using it for more than a month and have not found anything bad. It works very quietly.,Yes
5,"Predator ""Rocketship""","The Laptop is daBomb!
Fast with a lot of Stamina and Storage",Yes
5,Best price & performance,"If you want to buy gaming laptop with price & performance, exactly you need to choose this one.",Yes
5,Best for price,Very good for price and spec it has. With the specs is the best price will find.,Yes
3,price to performance but cheerful about defective,Thermal and performance is not up to the mark. Good for gpu intensive work at this price range. Mine getting crashed while playing even videos even after driver updates if work in battery,No
3,It was okay,"The laptop is decent, running games like call of duty was laggy.",No
5,The laptop is better than other for the price,Excellent for this price. Temperature GPU is 50-70*C,Yes
5,Amazon screen,Looks amazing runs at good temps not to hot worth the money should last 4years,Yes
1,poor quality,"this was my first Acer Predator gaming laptop. I buy new laptop with every nvidia series drop and this looked like a great value at the begining and i bought it. After some time of use i relalised how poor the material quality is. Even while im typing this comment it is glitching and freezing time to time. when you game on this laptop it freezez hen you put your hand on wasd side. switches between integrated and gaming vga is another freeze session. I dont recommend this. I would never buy anything other than Asus ROG, other asus series are bad choice as well",No
1,Recall and Fire Hazard,"Potential fire hazard. I burned my hand and almost burned my backpack. It got too hot, and I could smell the burn. It's not possible to travel with it. If you carry it in your backpack with all the apps closed and in sleep mode, expect a burn. I tried everything, but nothing seems to work. I don't think replacing the motherboard will solve it. I may have to report it to Safety Commissions due to potential fire hazard. I cannot travel with this laptop anywhere due to a fear of it burning.",No
1,Would Not Recommend.,"Had issues from the first boot.  Would restart randomly whether just starting up, browsing the internet or playing a game. Got very, very hot while playing a mid tier game or higher.  Screen would also flicker at any given time. I updated all the drivers and BIOS, should not be happening. When returning I was told someone came in earlier that day with the exact same issues.  Would Not Recommend, swapped for a Lenovo.",No
4,"Good Price to Performance , 115w MGP","Reviews seem to be limited at the time of writing. This laptop provides great price to performance. But there is a reason its 1899.99.. this laptop form facter is different. While thin, the cooling vents make it have a larger surface area than you may think. This makes accessories and backpack fitment more challenging. The build quality is nice though. The 275HX CPU in this form factor is a monster if you need cores, the H series chips in similar formfactors get annihilated. The 5070 ti is fantastic for games and data science.  The memory is upgradeable which is a huge plus for those that need 64 or 96Gb. The screen is beautiful but glossy and may not be bright enough for viewing in brighter environments. Two M.2 storage slots. Ports are adequate for this price. The cooler and fans actually arent that bad and do a pretty good job. The power brick is very manageable in size. I think its 230W? Keyboard is good, but the trackpad has too much texure in my opinion which causes to much friction. I used this laptop for a few days but some things i just couldn't get over. One, the speakers are horrendous. The two speakers only cover mids and you have to play with the equalizer to get them somewhat acceptable. If you dont always wear headphones, this might really disappoint you. Secondly, the software is straight up bad. I dont understand why these big companies can't make a basic interface like the community made gHelper for asus. Acer locks down the CPU so undervolting is currently impossible via software. The Nvidia 5070 ti is great, but it's capped at 115w max graphics power or MGP.. that 115 includes the dynamic boost. You are absolutely buying a power limited 5070 ti and it shows. Maybe a 10-15% difference than full power 5070 ti laptops. It does do great in my opnion for the form factor though. If the software suite was just simple and the speakers were increased to 4 from a measly 2 and half decent, I may have kept it. It was so close!",No
3,Computer is shutting down randomly,For some weird reason the computer shuts down randomly.. gonna take it back and see what’s up,No
2,Disappointed,"The laptop froze a few times while running games, nvidia optimus setting causes glitches, and nvidia graphics optimizing also causes glitches in all the games. Specs are amazing for the price but unfortunately it is not a keeper",No
5,Holy grail of value,"In this overpriced market this unit really shines. Awesome specs for such a price, at least compared to the other options. Build quality is totally decent all around and the bottom is aluminum as is the back of the display. The display itself is gorgeous, really nice colors, it's a pleasant viewing experience. Plenty bright. It stays cool, and the fans dont get particularly loud unless you're really pushing the limits. The Core Ultra 9 is incredibly snappy and quick with whatever I throw at it, and the 5070ti has plenty of processing power and memory to work with the 2.5k display.",Yes
2,Mirror glossy screen ruins great laptop,This is an amazing rig except they ruined it with that glossy screen that is like a mirror.,No
1,Defective out of the box.,Was defective out of the box. Kept going into an unending reboot loop. I live over 6 hours from the nearest Best Buy so I had to ship it back to have it returned. Still waiting on a refund. I plan to get another one once my refund is issued. I'll update this review if it ends up being a fluke.,No
1,Not what was expected at all,Couldn't run basic adobe programs from the first week. Ran very hot. Traded in 2nd week for a competing brand.,No
1,overheats easily,Less than a month old and already having to take it back overheating,No
1,Slow processing,The laptop has a hard time processing even the smallest stuff in adobe after effects.,No
1,Bad labtop,Powers stop working.                   ............,No
5,A steal for the price point.,"Picked up this gem at Best Buy today. I initially went in to purchase a different gaming laptop at almost a similar price point. Upon looking at their inventory through the app when I was there, i noticed this laptop was available but not out for display. I asked the customer service rep about it and they werent even aware that they had it in stock themselves. So he was shocked. Looked it over and youre getting some amazing value here. OLED screen, which by the way, looks gorgeous. 16"" screen, 240hz display, 32 freaking gigs of ram and 1TB SSD. This was a winner. Opened it up at home, installer some games to test drive and all work flawlessly. The games were Warzone, Elden Ring, Red Dead Redemption, League of Legends, and WoW, all which were on MAX settings. It did get a bit hot at first but after running all the windows updates, it cooled off. It has all the ports you will need including an ethernet port for all you hardwired freaks like me. 3 USB connections, HDMI, and well pretty much everything youll need to rock and roll. Only time will tell of how long the quality of this product will last since Im not familiar with Acer as much (I have a Lenovo Legion desktop) but it seems like a well built product and definitely feels premium. I have the total gech protection for 2 years so im not too worried. Overall, a fine purchase!",Yes
5,Amazing!,"Very happy that I went with this laptop. The screen is amazing and the thermals seem to be pretty good. I pushed the system pretty hard and the GPU stayed in the low 80s and the CPU in the low 90s. Also, the advertised screen refresh rate here on Best Buy (165hz) is not correct. The screen is actually 240hz, which was a pleseant surprise. I was a bit worried buying this as it is a slim variant (less GPU wattage) and there arent many major reviews out. Ran some benchmarks and it only came 7-8% less than the average 5070ti laptop. The only downside to this laptop is that the speakers seem to be pretty low quality, but thats not a big deal to me.",Yes
5,The Best Laptop I’ve Never Touched,"Wow — the Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S AI is incredible! At least, I assume it is. It’s been months since I ordered it, and while it hasn’t actually arrived, just thinking about those specs gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside.

I mean, who wouldn’t be excited about a 16” OLED 165Hz screen, Intel Core Ultra 9, RTX 5070Ti, 32GB of RAM, and a full terabyte of storage? It’s basically a spaceship disguised as a laptop. Too bad it’s still on its intergalactic journey to my doorstep.

But hey, patience builds character, right? At this rate, by the time it shows up, there might be a Predator Helios Neo 17 with AI that makes coffee — but I’ll cherish this mythical beast all the same.

Highly recommend… if you’re into long-term relationships with tracking numbers.",Yes
5,"Great Value, Little Comprimise","I almost slept on this because of the Acer brand (always saw Acer as a lower end brand). However, the screen on this laptop really is beautiful. I had a 14” Zephyrus, and that thing got hot. This is able to get way more fps and does an amazing job handling the heat. 2 cons really: 1) i noticed the system can get bogged down and unresponsive sometimes. Not sure if this is Windows related or hardeare related. 2) im not an audiohile, but the soeakers are ok. I had to turn off Spatial sound so that i could actually hear the games. Overall, really great value! (Also came with a neoprene laptop sleeve, nice surprise!)",Yes
4,Great laptop especially for architecture,I have 2 months with the computer and at the moment it is in perfect conditions.,Yes
5,The best,"The best, poor sound and batery life, but is like McQueen . Xd",Yes
5,Happy customer,Best laptop I have seen for this price $1899 for a rtx5070ti OLED 240hz is by far the best deal,Yes
5,When will this be available,"When is this expected to become available, weve all been patiently waiting",Yes
5,When will it be available,When will it drop and why it says sold out i don't get it,Yes
2,Unsure of this yet.,"Very nice laptop when it is not crashing on me. Also very concerned with how hot it runs (90-100 F), but support says that is normal. I wish I had confidence in this purchase, but unfortunately I do not. Trying to see what support can do before I return it because I am afraid this will not last",No
1,Junk,"This laptop had the best proce to specs ratio. The predatorsense software doesnt work when it comes to updating. I went to manually update things and the website doesnt explain anything at all. It still doesnt update. Lastly, this is not 165hz its 240hz. Which should be good right?? Wrong, the screennis locked at 240hz. I tried absolutely everything. Ddu gpu drivers. Fresh insall. And went through all the recommended steps with Acer support. Nothing works. A laptop needs to be at a lower refresh rate when unplugged. It eats through battery life crazy fast at 240hz. Will be returning this.",No
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!,Runs great and smooth! I love how the keyboard goes into a rainbow light show when it turns on or you press a key,Yes
5,Sweet Dreams,"Every day I wake up and thank the lord for sending me this powerful machine, oh wait, that’s just my pillow… maybe tomorrow I’ll have this delivered to my door.",Yes
5,Release date please?,Release date please?  We are egerly waiting for it.,Yes
