5,Aprobada y recomendada,"I recommend it, it has great capacity to run heavy programs, it supports, works with fluids, but if you want it not to heat up and work better, use it while it is connected to the electricity because it discharges a little faster, I recommend it for those who work in places where you can connect it, of course it lasts without being connected to the electricity but it would last around 2 or 3 hours maximum, I recommend it 100%. for office work or similar, the image, the fluidity and quick reaction of the keyboards and how impressive it doesn't heat up compared to other computers when you put it at 70% of its capacity, I recommend it for 3D work, heavy games, for programming, editing photos and videos, the only thing you have to look at is the battery, but for the rest. I have no complaints, this fulfills what I want .",OctavioM,"Oct 17, 2025 1:29 PM",Yes,Yes,1,No,0,
5,Upgrade Blows My Desktop Away,"I purchased this laptop to replace my desktop that couldn’t upgrade to windows 11. The performance of this machine is absolutely night and day. I game, stream, and edit videos as some of my heavier tasks and my desktop was able to run these programs okay. They had to be on the lowest settings possible to run smoothly. With this laptop, everything is running on Highest settings and flawlessly at that. My biggest games are Overwatch 2, Anno 1800, and Hoyoverse titles. After some adjustments in the system settings (making sure the games were running on the dGPU instead of hybrid, etc) every title is running perfectly. You can set up and be playing in minutes. The OLED display is beautiful. It’s capable of HDR but I honestly prefer the OLED for gaming. It has a decent battery life. I don’t game while unplugged but while I’m unplugged just browsing or using discord, it lasts plenty long enough for me. I have not fully tested this yet however. 

I was upgrading from a GTX 1060, and I can tell the difference drastically. In FPS games, suddenly it makes sense how other people could use snipers and I couldn’t. The frames are just that much smoother, that much easier to work with. I was nervous to drop this kind of money on a laptop with how much gripe they get, but I have zero regrets. This thing is better than my desktop ever was, even 6 years ago. I have yet to run into an issue it can’t handle. It’s lighter than I thought it’d be too. Maybe slightly heavier than my old MacBook Pro? But not enough to be noticeable by any means. I am very pleased with this purchase and if you’re also on the fence about a laptop in this price range, I say go for it.",SHAE,"Sep 15, 2025 3:35 PM",Yes,Yes,3,No,0,
5,Great Performance and Build Quality,"This Lenovo Legion 7i is excellent. The build feels premium, the screen is bright and very smooth, and the performance is outstanding for gaming and multitasking. Games run fast with no stuttering, and the laptop stays reasonably cool for how powerful it is. The fans can get loud and the battery isn’t the best, but that’s normal for a gaming laptop.

5,"Lenovo Legion 7i Intel Core Ulta 9 275 HX, 32 GB M","I'm a huge Lenovo fan, and I absolutely fell in love with this computer aesthetically, and I'd never seen such a great screen. It's my first high-end computer. I had to seek some advice on the BIOS and driver, but Lenovo itself has very good guides inside the computer.
For gaming, I imagine it's normal for it to get hot like any computer. I had the previous version, and it got so hot it shut off on its own that I returned it under warranty. I spent a little more money and got this beauty.
I haven't had any problems and have enjoyed high performance for gaming. I learned this option when I put it in work mode by simply pressing the fn + R keys, and I thought it was fantastic.
In a few months, I'd like the new one, which has a larger screen with 4K resolution.

5,Perfect for me,"After looking at several laptops, some with the RTX5070TI or even the 5080 I kept getting called back to this one for some reason. The reason was the appearance, it is sleek and stylish. After getting it home and trying it out for the last month I am in no way disappointed. Games extremely well for me, but I am not a huge gamer so I am not playing demanding games. It gets loud, but not as loud as my previous Alienware with an RTX 2070, and that would also throttle down when gaming and sometimes freeze, this never has. I did remove a few of the installed apps that IO did not care for or would hang the system up, but other than that I truly love it, especially the screen.",BumbleJake,"Sep 26, 2025 11:44 AM",Yes,Yes,0,No,0,

4,Really good but may need manufacturer tweaks,It’s beautiful and I’ve gotten many compliments. Compared to my last laptop (1060) it’s an amazing improvement but the graphics card had issues that required me to replace it within 60 days. Replacement also starting to experience some issues with ports recognizing USB devices. Reddit threads show similar issues with other users.

5,Power house!,"I couldn’t be happier with my new Lenovo Legion 7i 16” OLED Gaming Laptop! From the moment I turned it on, the speed and clarity blew me away. The Intel Core Ultra 9 and RTX 5070 handle everything I throw at it — from AutoCAD and design software to gaming and video editing — all without breaking a sweat.

The OLED display is absolutely stunning; colors pop with incredible depth and the 2.5K resolution makes every detail shine. The build quality feels premium, the RGB keyboard is smooth and responsive, and even under heavy use, it stays surprisingly cool and quiet.

This laptop has completely elevated my productivity and creativity — it’s perfect for design students, professionals, and gamers alike. If you’re looking for top-tier performance in a beautiful, lightweight package, this is the one.

Highly recommend it — worth every penny!

5,Lenovo Legion 7i,"The Legion 7i, especially its latest 2025 iteration (Gen 10), ships with cutting-edge specs like the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor paired with NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs—up to the RTX 5080—delivering jaw-dropping performance. In benchmarks, it leads the pack. Gaming and visuals come alive on its 16-inch, 240 Hz OLED WQXGA panel—vibrant, color-accurate, and silky-smooth. The Legion 7i combines a sleek, modern aesthetic with smart ergonomics. It garners praise for its clean design and abundant ports—including Thunderbolt 4, USB-C/A, HDMI 2.1, and RJ-45—ideal for gaming setups and creative workflows alike.
Thanks to its advanced cooling system, the CPU can consistently operate at ~150–170 W, even when under load, with temperatures around 85–90 °C and fan noise between 45–46 dBA—impressive for such power.
The Legion 7i’s SteelSeries-based keyboard delivers excellent tactile feedback, quiet typing, and unique features like force-sensing WASD keys and customizable keycaps—ideal for precision gaming.
Minor Trade-Offs
• Pricey & Heavy: The best-in-class hardware comes at a cost, both financially (starting around $2,849) and in portability (nearly 6 lb)
• Battery Life: Like most powerful gaming laptops, it has below-average battery endurance—not ideal for extended unplugged use.
• Thermal Sensitivity: To get peak sustained performance, it's best placed on a stand to improve airflow—the cooling design is very capable, but flat desk usage might push thermal limits.",XXXXX,"Aug 15, 2025 10:41 AM",Yes,Yes,1,No,0,

5,Great buy!!,"I recently purchased the Lenovo Legion laptop, and it has exceeded all of my expectations. The build quality feels premium, and the sleek white design really stands out. Performance-wise, it’s an absolute powerhouse — the NVIDIA RTX graphics combined with the latest processor handle gaming, streaming, and multitasking with ease. The display is crisp and vibrant, and the refresh rate makes everything feel smooth and responsive.

One of my favorite features is the RGB keyboard, which not only looks great but also feels very comfortable to type on during long sessions. Cooling is efficient, so the laptop stays surprisingly quiet even under heavy loads.

Overall, this is one of the best laptops I’ve owned — perfect for gaming, content creation, and productivity. Best Buy’s ordering and pickup process was smooth and hassle-free, too. Highly recommend this machine to anyone looking for power and style in one package.",Andy,"Sep 19, 2025 11:50 AM",Yes,Yes,0,No,0,
5,Best looking laptop,"Got one refurbished-excellent on sale for $1380 before tax.

You pay for the build quality, and it’s worth the price.  It’s clean and professional, without any gaming aesthetic.  The display blew me and my girlfriend away even compared to other OLED laptop screens; she’s (jokingly) jealous of how good this thing is and she by no means skimped out on her own gaming laptop.  

I’m impressed by how powerful the 275HX CPU is as well, though it’s a little too powerful for the chassis.  It’s somehow got more computing power than my desktop 13700k at half the wattage; intel arrow lake isn’t impressive as a desktop chip but it’s a big improvement for laptop chips.  My legion 7 will thermal throttle well before the cpu is fully utilized; consider undervolting and frequency limiting or setting a custom fan curve since it’s got cpu horsepower to spare.

The GPU is the weakest point of this laptop; everyone complains the 5070 with 8gb vram is insufficient and it really does struggle with 1440p gaming.  There’s no getting around it; go for something with a 5070 ti or greater if graphics-heavy gaming is important.  Or, like, use a desktop instead.

I sure like how it looks though, and I think its aesthetics and build quality make up for its shortcomings in graphics, thermals and battery life compared to other laptops at a similar price.  At any sale price at $1700 or below I think this thing warrants consideration for anyone who doesn’t use a laptop solely for gaming.  Or who does and doesn’t want to look like they do.",Lily,"Oct 11, 2025 2:27 AM",Yes,Yes,1,No,0,

You’d think laptops would be able to perform this basic feature. But it was so bad that I barely managed to get through the initial setup! After that, it couldn’t hold a steady connection for more than a minute. 

Worst part is that if you look up “lenovo legion 7i gen 10 can't connect to internet” on Google, you’ll find other folks with the same problem. But who would bother to look up if a *laptop* can connect to the *internet* before buying, in the year 2025? Silly me for thinking that was a given.

3,"Great Specs, Broken Customization (Legion Station)","I bought this Lenovo Legion and, while it’s a very powerful machine, I’m giving it three stars for a couple of issues. First, it shipped with Windows 11 2024 instead of the 2025 version. Second, the Lenovo “Legion Station” app has a bug that forces the keyboard lighting and dark mode back to default every time I restart, ignoring my saved settings. I contacted both Best Buy and Lenovo; the only ‘solution’ they offered was to return the laptop. Uninstalling the app stopped the resets, but now I can’t customize the keyboard lighting or use certain performance/shortcut modes the software enables. It’s frustrating to have to accept this kind of limitation on a laptop that costs over two thousand dollars.",Malfonso,"Jul 19, 2025 10:46 PM",Yes,Yes,4,No,0,

5,Great Overall Laptop,"Lenovo nailed it with this laptop. First of all great design and man, so light weight. Second, the display is just immaculate. I got an hp omen max with an rtx 5080 and this just performs so much better than that despite having a 5070 gpu. You would need to do some tweaking in legion space as the CPU temp limits are set to 103 by default. Bring that down and increase the GPU wattage and baam you now have a thin, light extremely good gaming laptop with pretty much all games running smooth like butter.

The build is solid and has a nice weight to it. The keyboard feels great to type on, which is important for me since I use it for more than just games. My only complaints are the battery life, which isn’t amazing, and the fans, which get pretty loud when it’s working hard.

Overall I don’t regret spending the money at all. It’s fast, it’s beautiful, and it feels like it’ll last me a long time.",AaronB,"Aug 23, 2025 5:15 PM",Yes,Yes,0,No,0,

Screen is crisp, keys are phenomenal (they do feel a bit cramped with full keyboard but it works), performance is great.  You need to have this plugged in or the battery gets consumed pretty quickly playing games but shouldn't be a surprise with whats under the hood.

Would not recommend putting this on your lap as it gets toasty on the underside but the keys are just fine for use even when you're flexing the power of the machine.  Would definitely buy again.",EricN,"Nov 19, 2025 9:29 PM",Yes,Yes,0,No,0,
5,So far so good,"I’ve only had it for a few days but it’s already 10x better than my MacBook Pro that I paid double the price for 6 years ago. It does things quick and the visuals are incredible. It seems to be decent with multitasking, but I haven’t put it to the real test yet. I only have two issues, the screen brightness and volume buttons don’t work for some reason??? But as I’m troubleshooting, it looks like this is common and can be fixed. I also am having trouble running emulators for older games, but that’s probably more just finding the sweet spot in settings.
