5,Alienware Laptop - Out of this world!!,"Top notch quality, easy setup and, honestly, the best components. You configure them according to your needs but Dell makes it easy and protects you during configuration to not place incompatible parts together. I configured mine for trading and it works great with 4 external monitors (using an other world computing USB-C hub). I like the idea of a portable machine with the power of a desktop. Great overall experience, easy and fast. Cant ask for more! #sweepstakes",MoneyMaker,17 days ago,From Michigan,Yes,Yes

5,Better than expected,"Kind of a base model with RTX 5080, 1TB SSD, 32 GB, 18"" screen, base keyboard. It was on sale for $1000 off. If I tried to switch to the better keyboard, the price increased about $650, so obviously they were getting rid of some inventory. For the price, I think it was a good deal, and I wanted a laptop with a large screen and decent GPU. Overall, I'm very happy with it, but I have yet to travel with it. It is big and heavy, but I do have a backpack it fits. I've only had it a month, no issues.",Kralon,24 days ago,From Utah,Yes,Yes

5,First Gaming Laptop for me! AWESOME,"This is the first ""gaming"" laptop I have bought and might I add not disappointed at all. I am in the IT field so knew what I wanted and this had all the specs i could want/ask for with minor customization. Extremely happy with the performance and function of it, my only drawback is the wattage needed as they don't have a docking station to supply the 360 watts and you get pop up about could impact performance as the biggest one I could fine was only 300 watt which is what Dell recommended. Had some quirky issues with the laptop and docking station but seem to resolved em all.

5,Alienware 18 - Area 51 Great Features,"After buying Dell laptops for 30+ years, I can say they are well made and, if you have a problem, Dell will make it right. The Alienware 18 Area 51 laptop I bought was priced right and has great features. The extra cost Cherry Keyboard is well worth it and should be standard. The positive clicky feeling is the way mechanical keyboards should operate. Unfortunately, the laptop they sent me had a problem with the WIFI 7 adapter. It worked on WIFI 6 but had issues with WIFI 7. Dell tech support is always there, and they tried to assist, but hardware issues require replacement. This laptop has the WIFI adapter soldered to the motherboard, which prevents an easy fix. As far as I'm concerned, this is a design flaw. WIFI cards should be user replaceable and upgradable. Dell learned the hard way as I returned this laptop for a refund and purchased another brand with a user replaceable WIFI 7 card. But I say with confidence that my other Dell laptops have been extremely dependable and rugged so you can't go wrong with a Dell laptop.",Rooski,3 months ago,From Philadelphia PA,Yes,Yes

5,It's a Beast,"Overall, the system is a beast. I have yet to find its upper end except on AI development (hint: there is no upper end). Eats games for breakfast. Cooling is more than adequate, although I do use a cooling pad with fans. Congrats to your engineers. Now we'll see if it lasts 5 years... I do have two wishes: 1) Laptop engineers seem to think that keeping a standard keyboard will put them out of a job. Create a little app that, when you press a key (How DF do you use the M1 key?) it gives you all the info you need. You can skip letters, thank you. 2) Have a simple, direct way to set the battery to 80% max charge. Phones do it, tablets do it, you're way late and it's not a hard job for your lovely engineers.",Anonymous,3 months ago,,Yes,

5,Alienware 18 Area 51 Gaming Laptop,"I got the intel 9 ultra with 5090 64gb ram 2TB ssd model and it blows my Alienware Aurora R14 desktop 3080 with Ryzen 5 5500 32gb ram out of the water. Can't believe how powerful this thing is after reading the laptop GPUs are roughly 30% weaker than desktop GPUs. Maybe it is compared to a desktop 5090 but even running the most intensive games this thing doesn't even sweat. It's heavy as expected but otherwise it's pretty quiet, runs great, and love the 300hz monitor slightly better quality than my 240hz 1080p desktop monitors. Ended up getting it for around 3k which is what I paid for my R14 almost 5-6 years ago now.",Eric,3 months ago,From Delaware,Yes,Yes

I also wish some of the new product launch's had more customization options in terms of hardware (ie hard drive choices).

5,All it's cracked up to be.,"Cons: It's huge, and the cord isn't very long nor the battery life great, thus, not a great curl up on the couch and write laptop, but I have an aging lightweight dell that still works fine as a basic word processor, and I had zero expectations for a gaming laptop to have a good battery life. It can get toasty, but no more than other gaming laptops, and you definitely do not need any external cooling fans or anything. It's a little slow on startup and doesn't recognize my USB mouse right away, but that's trivial compared to the pros. Fingerprints easily show up on the pretty casing. Hate the huge copilot key, which could have been made miniscule so the home and end keys could be more conveniently located. FYI: I ordered mostly top specs as far as 5090 and 64 gig ram. Only did the 2TB gen4 SSD as I'd hit (ahem, exceeded) my budget max already, but it might have been worth the bigger and gen5 SSD to better future proof, maybe, maybe not. Pros: It's very pretty. Flawlessly runs KCD2, BG3, and heavily modded skyrim, all at max graphics, and is very pretty and fluid on the attached screen or when hooked up to 65 inch TV. I don't game online so I can't say how it performs, but the download speeds over wifi are impressive, so I suspect that wouldnt be a problem. Overall a huge upgrade from my prior PCs, such as my aging Alienware desktop and my prior 4060 laptop, which could run the above mentioned games at medium graphics yet still lagged. Easily runs other apps like photoshop, of course. Overall: Highly recommend. I'm thrilled with it, glad I upgraded, and think this will get a lot of miles out of it.",C,4 months ago,From Pacific Northwest,Yes,Yes

5,"A Gamer's Dream: Alienware 18"" Area-51 laptop","My Alienware 18"" Area-51 Gaming Laptop is transformative. It's a powerhouse, a visual marvel, and a testament to Alienware's commitment to top-tier gaming. From unboxing, its premium feel, ""Liquid Teal"" finish, and robust magnesium alloy chassis impressed. The mesmerizing Alienware RGB lighting enhances the gaming atmosphere. The 18-inch WQXGA (2560 x 1600) 300Hz/3ms display is breathtaking. Games are stunningly clear, vibrant, and unbelievably smooth, making every frame alive. Under the hood, my Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 configuration handles everything with ease. I upgraded to 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a blazing-fast 2TB NVMe M.2 PCIe Gen5 SSD, ensuring lightning-quick load times. AAA titles run at max settings with incredible frame rates, rivaling desktop setups. The cooling system is a triumph. Even during intense sessions, the laptop remains remarkably cool, preventing thermal throttling. The fans are a pleasant ""whoosh"" and unnoticeable with a headset. The Cherry MX mechanical keyboard offers tactile feedback and comfortable, responsive typing. Per-key AlienFX RGB lighting adds personalization. Though large, its portability for a machine of this caliber is impressive, perfect for LAN parties. The array of ports, including Thunderbolt 5, is convenient. In conclusion, the Alienware 18"" Area-51 is an absolute triumph. It's a no-compromise gaming machine delivering an unparalleled experience. For serious gamers seeking the best in mobile performance, stunning visuals, and a premium build, this is an investment in pure gaming bliss.

But, once inside, it's phenomenal. Tremendous quality and feel of the mechanical keyboard. Beautiful screen, quite bright and vivid. I lowered the illumination to 50%. Sound, good quality, but don't expect it to knock out your bedroom windows. It's just enough and necessary, sound-wise. I notice that they managed very well the architecture of this computer to manage the internal temperature. I can only say, that the legend is back...",Bald Eagle,5 months ago,From Costa Rica,Yes,Yes
5,Real quality in laptop thermal design.,"I tried about 3 other 5000 series laptops before picking the Alienware 18 inch with a 5090 in it, I have to say I am not disappointed. I have never seen thermals so good in a laptop, ever and I've managed two computer stores repairing laptops in the past. It draws in air from the top! Why have I never seen this in a laptop before, the fans aren't loud and even while benchmarking it does not thermal throttle, I get temps on the 5090 in the 60 most of the time while playing, sometime 71 max and 70 for the CPU.. this exact config on the HP omen max hit 105c after one minute of benchmarking. Screen is not OLED but it's still a great screen probably best I've seen on an IPS display, build quality is solid and nice, the typing experience with the cherry mx keys is awesome I get a great score on monkey type, similar to my ergo desktop keyboard score. This is a beast the only thing I would warn you is it's HUGE and heavy but the 16 inch variant does not perform as well as this one, if you are considering one versus the other get the 18 and go big you won't regret it. If you travel a lot and want something easy to take with you look elsewhere altogether but if you want a real desktop replacement that won't burn itself up in a year get this bad boy",Vax,5 months ago,,Yes,Yes

5,nice and high quality exterior,thunderbolt 5 does not exist on this laptop at all. the USBC is more like usb3.2 30w but the ports are split in 2 and given the USB4 driver 4k60hz is a maximum per port on this pc as a result of false advertisement timespy gives a nice 22k score. R24 2000 score USB charging is either not currently supported or i do not have a device capable of the minimum 96w to charge as stated by the Manuel(or because thunderbolt is just missing completely) everything else about the laptop even down to the thermals are correct. as for drivers(dell rhymes with h&ll) its not normal compared to a desktop driver install. genuine windows 11 is safe to install but the drivers require installing in a certain order to not go corrupt. hybrid graphics seems to use more power then dedicated graphics by about 30w even for idle cases. i have this system down to 50w.(hybrid was 80w),crowbarstrong,6 months ago,From brisbane,Yes,No
5,Absolutely gorgeous machine,"The cooling solution (the cryochamber) in this beauty is absolutely doing a spectacular job. Solid 10/5! I don't recall ever seeing a high end gaming laptop with cooling this good! (From Alienware or otherwise). The Intel Ultra Core 275hx and the RTX 5080 actually go to their advertised speeds of 160W and 175W respectively with a combined power up to 280W under constant load favouring the GPU or CPU based on the power/thermal profile used. With 4 speakers (2 woofers and 2 tweeters) you can probably hold a party with this machine! (The speakers are that load yes!) 2 SODIMM slots with memory up to 6400MT/s + 3 Nvme Gen 5 Slots + 2 Thunderbolt 5 slots + 5Gbit Ethernet, Full size SD card, regular Type A usb 3 ports, I couldn't ask for more (perhaps a mini-displayport port would have been nice, but we get a full HDMI 2.1 port - not the mini version of it, so no complaints there). I love the Liquid Teal colour. It reminds me of Alienware of old! Only gripe is that the screen is IPS and not OLED, but I don't want glossy OLED, I would have liked a matte OLED screen (Valve was able to do it for the Steam Deck OLED, so maybe next time Alienware can do it as well ^_^). However, the IPS at 500+ nits and 100% DCIP-3 accuracy is one of the best IPS panels I have ever experienced and it's matte, which is a MAJOR WIN! It is ""thin"" at least compared to the previous Alienware Area-51m R2 (or R1) and it is a desktop replacement, but with just one power-brick this time instead of two (thank God!) My only recommendation is to grab the 18' backpack! I was absolutely impressed with the quality! And funny enough, even if the laptop is quite heavy at around 5kg with the adapter, it is very comfortable to travel with (Previously I have used my Vindicator 17' backpack with my 17x laptop and Area-51m R1/R2 laptops. I will let you with a few shots of the laptop and how it looks compared with the previous Area-51m R1 :)",Helifax,6 months ago,From Guildford,Yes,Yes
5,Powerhouse - Buy it! No regrets.,"I have upgraded from a 15"" 4070 to this 18"" 5080. Handling 4K resolution at max graphics better then i expected. Black Myth Wukong sits between 30-45FPS. I'm currently playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on ""experimental"" settings and not noticing any problems with frame rate at 2560 x 1600 Be wary of the surface you put the laptop onto. The bottom can get scratched if you put it on a rugged surface. I left mine on a metal mouse mat and the edges of the mouse mat caught it and caused some scuff marks. Its heavy, but comfortable on the lap. It does get toasty, not uncomfortable at all but you do start to sweat. I would recommend you find an appropriate tray to keep you cool. My previous 4070 laptop would regularly run at 90+ degrees and you couldn't touch the laptop for long without burning yourself. I haven't had that experience here. If you were unsure about the mechanical keyboard, just do it! If you're a touch typist like myself, you won't notice you're using an American layout keyboard. Its well worth the money and has made typing on this machine so much nicer.",GenGenAtro,6 months ago,From Birmingham,Yes,Yes

I'm happy with the performance sitting around 45 FPS for Black Myth Wukong at 4K maxed out settings, realistically you won't want to have everything maxed, so dial it down and have a consistent 60FPS. The wrist rest is very comfortable. The 18"" screen fills your field of view and doesn't feel small. The laptop is heavy, charger is small.

4,Alienware 18 Area-51 for industrial field service,"Cross-shopped this laptop with Dell business class laptops and Panasonic offerings for rough business use. When you add extended service contract costs and compare features, Alienware is competitive despite high purchase cost. I operate in the desert southwest. When I am forced to work outside in 100+ °F and direct sunlight, the screen affords a wider viewing angle like no others, and the advanced cooling system design helps a lot. Indoors, the cooling system is relevant in industrial hot zones. This system with the power brick is over 12 lbs, but I always pack a lot more than that to a job site.",rck,15 days ago,From arizona,Yes,Yes
4,Amazing Laptop with one flaw.,Needed a new gaming laptop & after A LOT of research settled on this Alienware 18 Area51. Easy to spec on website & easy checkout. Kept well informed by email & text during ordering & building. Laptop arrived TWO WEEKS later well packaged. Looks stunning & very well built. Hasn't miss a beat with gaming & keeps cool throughout.

The performance is great, and the laptop stays pretty cool even while I'm playing demanding games like Battlefield 6 or Alan Wake 2. I also love the keyboard, it's significantly better than the keyboard on my old Lenovo Legion laptop. My only real (but still fairly minor) complaint is with the screen, the resolution is fine but the dynamic range is definitely lacking. Not enough to really bother me, but I was hoping for a little more for Alienware's highest end laptop. Overall very happy, and if in a few years Alienware announces a new version of this laptop with an improved screen I could definitely see myself upgrading!",Patch,25 days ago,,Yes,Yes
4,"Great, with blemishes","Overall, awesome laptop. The performance has exceeded my expectations. The build quality is top notch. Issues I've found: The screen backlight is very noticeable in blacks. The material used for the case is a grease magnet and easily scratched. The laptop would randomly crash / close out of some games. The Alienware command center app is not user friendly. Happy with the product, but for the price I wanted it to run flawlessly. I can live with the screen, but not the random performance.",Matthew,26 days ago,,Yes,Yes

My only complaint is it was shipped with cosmetic damage. From the photo below you can see the inner box it was packaged in was clearly damaged but it was shipped anyway. The actual damage is basically cosmetic and I didn't raise any issues due to not wanting to deal with the delay of returning the product for replacement.,Tom,2 months ago,,Yes,Yes

4,Excellent Hardware,"This 18"" laptop is superb. There was a task I avoided using my old Asus laptop for because the screen was too small and was underpowered in other ways. I waited repeatedly, and what should have been an enjoyable process resulted in my frustration. That task is now a pleasure again using this new laptop!",Richard,2 months ago,From Toronto,Yes,Yes
4,It's a great laptop for gaming and other activities,"When I ordered this Area-51 18 inch laptop I thought it would come with the fan and touch pad LEDs. When it arrived and did not have them I had to look deeper at the description to see that those only came with certain graphic card systems. The laptop pictures on the Dell website showed those additional LEDs, but it wasn't clear in the description that those were only on certain models. I was disappointed when the laptop arrived and those weren't on it. I would have ordered a different system with those included had it been made more apparent on the site. I'm not unhappy with the laptop, just disappointed that the LEDs are not a part of it.",Disappointed,2 months ago,From Maryland,Yes,Yes
4,Could do better,Received my laptop as promised. Was disappointed at the sound. For a gaming laptop with all the top choices would expect the sound to be better and louder. Even with an external base speaker volume limited. The other disappointment was the box it came in. This is a box you expect to see on the shelf not during shipment. Notifies any and all what's being shipped and could sprout legs at any point leaving the customer hi and dry. Expect more from a premium computer maker,Alex,2 months ago,"From Lufkin, tx",Yes,Yes

4,Alienware m18 with RTX 5090 – Powerhouse or Price Trap?,"The Alienware m18 is an impressive laptop — no doubt. It's ideal for creators and professionals who need strong mobile performance, or gamers who want desktop-like power in one portable machine. But make no mistake: this is not true 5090 performance. For the same money, a desktop would give you 30–40% more raw power. If mobility matters, and money is no issue, this is one of the best laptops you can buy. If you're expecting a true desktop replacement? You'll be left a bit underwhelmed. Rating: 4.1/5 Premium, portable, powerful — but not a full desktop killer.",The Illusion 5090,4 months ago,,Yes,No

4,Out of This World Awesome,"Due to my newly acquired nomadic lifestyle, I desperately needed a portable desktop. CES came along and I waited for all major brands to release their top teir offerings. Every single one did not have the build quality, features, and specs in the same pricepoint other than the Alienware. The team behind this product not only knocked it out of the park, but out of this world! Although, my unit did arrive with a tiny scratch at the top cover, the laptop performs above and beyond my expectations.",Gary W,5 months ago,,Yes,Yes
4,Powerhouse with minor problems.,"Computer works great for VR. Gaming wise, Nvidia is still fixing the drivers. Apparently there's a problem where having alot of extra vram makes some games act weird. I was seriously disappointed my favorite game crashes immediately so I can't play it ever again; I think it has to do with Nvidia dropping physics support in the new graphics cards. Also the alienware command center is broke AF. Beyond trying to reinstall, it's hit or miss that it'll work. I expect most of the software bugs to be fixed with time so I'd consider them minor flaws. I think for the price point, the reliability of dell, and quality/performance I would recommend this over every other gaming laptop.",Gamer,6 months ago,From USA,Yes,Yes

3,Powerful specs inside stylish laptop let down down by screen,"I got this laptop to replace my 8 year old XPS. I wasn't keen on Dell's new design of the XPS and wanted something that could house the latest generation of Nvidia GPU's. The Area 51 (18inch) ticked all the boxes - the chassis is well designed and looks very stylish indeed. So far I am very impressed with it and its thermal control when playing games appears to be very good for a laptop. I was left disappointed by the screen quality however. I had to return my first delivery as there was clearly a dead pixel (or a few) in the corner of the screen. I didn't notice any backlight bleed (BLB), but I only had the laptop on for a short time and had used it in a bright room. There are no dead pixels on the second one I ordered and kept, but the backlight bleeding and ips glow is noticeable when the screen is showing dark colours or if I'm not sat in a bright room. Reducing the brightness does help, but it's clear to see if I haven't got a light on. I understand that BLB and IPS glow are to be expected to some degree with this type of screen, but I would say the extent I have with my Area 51 laptop is the worst I've ever seen on an IPS screen and just barely acceptable for product in this price range. It's a shame really when everything else is so good. Perhaps I'm expecting too much from the technology, but when your paying several thousand for a laptop it should look and feel premium all over. Outside of dark colours, the screen does indeed look very good with no noticeable blemishes. I prefer to have an IPS screen for a laptop that's going to be used for games and music production/performance (over say an OLED which would cost a lot more and has it's own issues). I am happy enough with my purchase and hope this laptop will last as long as the last one I owned (the XPS felt flawless and was half the price). I just wonder if Dell could've done a better job ensuring the quality of the screen was on a par with the rest of the laptop prior to shipping. I would recommend it to someone who's prime consideration is having a portible, powerful machine with a well designed chassis for keeping all that tech cool. For anyone after superb visual fidelity without compromise on a laptop screen, look elsewhere.",Jo,3 months ago,From Northern Ireland,Yes,

3,The power I expect with the problems I expect,Powerful gaming laptop that can play just about anything with ease but it's still pretty heavy and bulky when compared to similarly powerful machines. Doesn't get as hot as some so that's nice. The demo area was loud so I can't speak to how quiet it not the fan is. It did blue screen on me at the end of my demo.,Sylvias,3 months ago,From Seattle,Yes,Yes

But, the Alienware command center and the dell support center is really buggy. And battery life is really really bad. 2 hours of screen time no matter how light work you do. 2 to 2:30 max with light browsing or watching a movie. If you do anything slightly heavier than that then do rely one battery.",Rakesh,4 months ago,,Yes,Yes

2,frustrating,"Well lets begin Positive about that: Thats pretty powerful ( ofc because not cheap ) pretty well design, delivered so fast. Negative: Lets start from beginning: when i launch for the first time screen was keep lagging and turning off, its so overheating in high performance games so if you would like to play some modern games without cooling pad impossible. Its so overpricing stuff. About noise understandable but same like airplane engine. ACC app keep crashing and lagging, sometimes its just unreal to log on to turn on or off something, just keep loading, also at the same time keyboard binds like volume changing or changing the screen brightness etc ofc not working as well. And biggest disappointing about volume problems. Volume in random moment once a day turn off and blocks without possible way to turn on or off or change volume, helps only rebooting sometimes or reinstalling drivers. All drivers working good any broken moments just randomly turn off. Thank you.",vvHyGodmode,3 months ago,From Winnipeg,Yes,No

2,"Solid laptop, overall experience ruined by marketing team",Purchased this on release with only two options of 5070 Ti and 5080 cards - however when delivered marketing conveniently released 5090 gfx card option a couple weeks later - Unreal Anyone running a small business in animation knows that the video card makes a SIGNIFICANT impact on decision making purchase process. Kudos to the team who designed the hardware - however marketing team ruined experience with outdated and unrealistic return policy for sole business owners unacceptable in 2025,Jay,6 months ago,,Yes,Yes
1,Dell does not care if you buy from them so go elsewhere.,The PC wouldn't let me make a backup drive and they do not care to help you even though they are working. When you point out their hours to them they will tell you to hold for the next available person knowing they are not going to help you. Once I got that message I submitted for a return.

1,Damaged Screen,"I've had 3 previous Alienware laptops and been generally satisfied. However, I've experienced problems with my current model which Tech struggled to support. I decided I'd invest nearly $12,000 AUD on an upgraded AW18 Area 51. It took about 3 weeks to arrive. The day after I received it I went to set it up and there is a damaged pixel in the middle of the screen! Imagine, surely they'd check that before dispatching! I'm so annoyed it's been about 3 weeks now and I still haven't contacted them!!!",Disgusted!,3 months ago,From Victoria,Yes,No

1,"Arrived Late, Damaged, Overheats, Support is AI Generated","My first experience with Dell was not positive. I'm used to building my own PCs and buying second hand laptops, and I figured I'd finally try Alienware since I've heard such great things about it almost 20 years ago. It's clear Alienware no longer lives up to its past reputation and has fallen from grace. - Laptop arrived late. Almost 2 months in, and I still don't have a working product I paid for. - Dell initially refused to honor their price match guarantee. - Laptop runs hot sitting in desktop only (25-35% persistent CPU usage, no apps, after win update + reboot). - Laptop CPU sits at 100% with just Firefox on Google home page. - Laptop arrived damage, vent was ruined during assembly. - Dell's support was almost entirely AI generated. I agreed to a refund to end this ordeal. I will not be buying from Dell again.",Larwri,6 months ago,,Yes,No
