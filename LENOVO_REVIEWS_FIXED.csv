5,Aprobada y recomendada,"I recommend it, it has great capacity to run heavy programs, it supports, works with fluids, but if you want it not to heat up and work better, use it while it is connected to the electricity because it discharges a little faster, I recommend it for those who work in places where you can connect it, of course it lasts without being connected to the electricity but it would last around 2 or 3 hours maximum, I recommend it 100%. for office work or similar, the image, the fluidity and quick reaction of the keyboards and how impressive it doesn't heat up compared to other computers when you put it at 70% of its capacity, I recommend it for 3D work, heavy games, for programming, editing photos and videos, the only thing you have to look at is the battery, but for the rest. I have no complaints, this fulfills what I want .",Yes
5,Upgrade Blows My Desktop Away,"I purchased this laptop to replace my desktop that couldn’t upgrade to windows 11. The performance of this machine is absolutely night and day. I game, stream, and edit videos as some of my heavier tasks and my desktop was able to run these programs okay. They had to be on the lowest settings possible to run smoothly. With this laptop, everything is running on Highest settings and flawlessly at that. My biggest games are Overwatch 2, Anno 1800, and Hoyoverse titles. After some adjustments in the system settings (making sure the games were running on the dGPU instead of hybrid, etc) every title is running perfectly. You can set up and be playing in minutes. The OLED display is beautiful. It’s capable of HDR but I honestly prefer the OLED for gaming. It has a decent battery life. I don’t game while unplugged but while I’m unplugged just browsing or using discord, it lasts plenty long enough for me. I have not fully tested this yet however. 

I was upgrading from a GTX 1060, and I can tell the difference drastically. In FPS games, suddenly it makes sense how other people could use snipers and I couldn’t. The frames are just that much smoother, that much easier to work with. I was nervous to drop this kind of money on a laptop with how much gripe they get, but I have zero regrets. This thing is better than my desktop ever was, even 6 years ago. I have yet to run into an issue it can’t handle. It’s lighter than I thought it’d be too. Maybe slightly heavier than my old MacBook Pro? But not enough to be noticeable by any means. I am very pleased with this purchase and if you’re also on the fence about a laptop in this price range, I say go for it.",Yes
5,Great Performance and Build Quality,"This Lenovo Legion 7i is excellent. The build feels premium, the screen is bright and very smooth, and the performance is outstanding for gaming and multitasking. Games run fast with no stuttering, and the laptop stays reasonably cool for how powerful it is. The fans can get loud and the battery isn’t the best, but that’s normal for a gaming laptop. Overall, great value and highly recommended.",Yes
5,"Legion 7i: Speed, Style & Serious Performance","⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The Legion 7i is a beast. Blazing fast Intel Ultra 9, smooth OLED display, RTX 5070 graphics, and plenty of memory/storage. Runs cool, looks sharp in Glacier White, and handles gaming + multitasking with ease. Worth every penny.",Yes
5,"Lenovo Legion 7i Intel Core Ulta 9 275 HX, 32 GB M","I'm a huge Lenovo fan, and I absolutely fell in love with this computer aesthetically, and I'd never seen such a great screen. It's my first high-end computer. I had to seek some advice on the BIOS and driver, but Lenovo itself has very good guides inside the computer.
For gaming, I imagine it's normal for it to get hot like any computer. I had the previous version, and it got so hot it shut off on its own that I returned it under warranty. I spent a little more money and got this beauty.
I haven't had any problems and have enjoyed high performance for gaming. I learned this option when I put it in work mode by simply pressing the fn + R keys, and I thought it was fantastic.
In a few months, I'd like the new one, which has a larger screen with 4K resolution.
This one has up to 2.5K, and I thought it was a beauty.",Yes
5,Lenovo gaming laptop,"Great laptop, Runs new games on high settings and manages to not overheat well.",Yes
5,"Excellent laptop Legion 7i ,OLED , RTX 5070","Excellent gaming computer Legion 7i with OLED colorful and brightness display ,great rendering, comfort, task speed enough RAM memory (32 Gb) to keep multitask process its like to drive a ferrari car , graphics are what i was expecting with this RTX 5070 i feel much better updated and powerful the investment in this aircraft (laptop) its good money investing for a long time",Yes
5,Lenovo Legion 7i,"The full aluminum build of this laptop is fascinating and the performance is powerful as well.

The OLED display quality surpassed my expectation. I recommend this laptop for people who is looking the balance between build quality, display, speaker, weight, and upgradability",Yes
5,"It runs smoothly, handles all","I’m  an architecture student, and this Lenovo Legion has been amazing for all my design and rendering work. It runs smoothly, hasn’t crashed once, and handles all my programs with ease. I especially love the backlit keyboard—it’s super comfortable to use and looks great during late-night work sessions.",Yes
5,Perfect for me,"After looking at several laptops, some with the RTX5070TI or even the 5080 I kept getting called back to this one for some reason. The reason was the appearance, it is sleek and stylish. After getting it home and trying it out for the last month I am in no way disappointed. Games extremely well for me, but I am not a huge gamer so I am not playing demanding games. It gets loud, but not as loud as my previous Alienware with an RTX 2070, and that would also throttle down when gaming and sometimes freeze, this never has. I did remove a few of the installed apps that IO did not care for or would hang the system up, but other than that I truly love it, especially the screen.",Yes
5,Excellent Device,Very brilliant device . I love it so much . Great for gaming and editing as well,Yes
5,Amazing Performer and Looks!!!,It is very sleek looking amazing gaming laptop. White color looks brilliant. I useed it for Video editing on Premere Pro and it’s very smooth. No lags. Brilliant display. Amazing looking colors and keyboard is very comfortable. Overall 10/10 for me.,Yes
4,Great quality,"Great laptop! picture is amazing, keyboard is nice to type on. Gaming is peak quality. Only downside is it does not have an Ethernet port. Could use some extra  peripherals, but I know you can get the next model up to get those. Just would have been nice. Battery lasts about 2.5-3 hours. Enough to watch a whole movie and still have life left over.",Yes
4,Really good but may need manufacturer tweaks,It’s beautiful and I’ve gotten many compliments. Compared to my last laptop (1060) it’s an amazing improvement but the graphics card had issues that required me to replace it within 60 days. Replacement also starting to experience some issues with ports recognizing USB devices. Reddit threads show similar issues with other users. Feels like there may be too much power for what it can push. Battery gets super hot. Considering exchanging again for a desktop.,No
5,Laptop,"Great quality, the AI function is definitely helpful for my studies.",Yes
5,Architecture student review,"I am an architecture student, this works great for my renderings and drawings. The cooling system is great , doesn’t get loud or unreasonably hot. The good thing about these is that  the fans are on the back unlike Alienware that has them on the top. They get full of dirt and overheat quickly",Yes
5,Power house!,"I couldn’t be happier with my new Lenovo Legion 7i 16” OLED Gaming Laptop! From the moment I turned it on, the speed and clarity blew me away. The Intel Core Ultra 9 and RTX 5070 handle everything I throw at it — from AutoCAD and design software to gaming and video editing — all without breaking a sweat.

The OLED display is absolutely stunning; colors pop with incredible depth and the 2.5K resolution makes every detail shine. The build quality feels premium, the RGB keyboard is smooth and responsive, and even under heavy use, it stays surprisingly cool and quiet.

This laptop has completely elevated my productivity and creativity — it’s perfect for design students, professionals, and gamers alike. If you’re looking for top-tier performance in a beautiful, lightweight package, this is the one.

Highly recommend it — worth every penny!

— Jana Spurloc",Yes
5,Lenovo Legion 7i,"The Legion 7i, especially its latest 2025 iteration (Gen 10), ships with cutting-edge specs like the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor paired with NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs—up to the RTX 5080—delivering jaw-dropping performance. In benchmarks, it leads the pack. Gaming and visuals come alive on its 16-inch, 240 Hz OLED WQXGA panel—vibrant, color-accurate, and silky-smooth. The Legion 7i combines a sleek, modern aesthetic with smart ergonomics. It garners praise for its clean design and abundant ports—including Thunderbolt 4, USB-C/A, HDMI 2.1, and RJ-45—ideal for gaming setups and creative workflows alike.
Thanks to its advanced cooling system, the CPU can consistently operate at ~150–170 W, even when under load, with temperatures around 85–90 °C and fan noise between 45–46 dBA—impressive for such power.
The Legion 7i’s SteelSeries-based keyboard delivers excellent tactile feedback, quiet typing, and unique features like force-sensing WASD keys and customizable keycaps—ideal for precision gaming.
Minor Trade-Offs
• Pricey & Heavy: The best-in-class hardware comes at a cost, both financially (starting around $2,849) and in portability (nearly 6 lb)
• Battery Life: Like most powerful gaming laptops, it has below-average battery endurance—not ideal for extended unplugged use.
• Thermal Sensitivity: To get peak sustained performance, it's best placed on a stand to improve airflow—the cooling design is very capable, but flat desk usage might push thermal limits.",Yes
1,Disappointing for expensive gaming laptop,I would not buy this product due to screen glitching out after two weeks of usage.,No
5,Great buy!!,"I recently purchased the Lenovo Legion laptop, and it has exceeded all of my expectations. The build quality feels premium, and the sleek white design really stands out. Performance-wise, it’s an absolute powerhouse — the NVIDIA RTX graphics combined with the latest processor handle gaming, streaming, and multitasking with ease. The display is crisp and vibrant, and the refresh rate makes everything feel smooth and responsive.

One of my favorite features is the RGB keyboard, which not only looks great but also feels very comfortable to type on during long sessions. Cooling is efficient, so the laptop stays surprisingly quiet even under heavy loads.

Overall, this is one of the best laptops I’ve owned — perfect for gaming, content creation, and productivity. Best Buy’s ordering and pickup process was smooth and hassle-free, too. Highly recommend this machine to anyone looking for power and style in one package.",Yes
5,Best looking laptop,"Got one refurbished-excellent on sale for $1380 before tax.

You pay for the build quality, and it’s worth the price.  It’s clean and professional, without any gaming aesthetic.  The display blew me and my girlfriend away even compared to other OLED laptop screens; she’s (jokingly) jealous of how good this thing is and she by no means skimped out on her own gaming laptop.  

I’m impressed by how powerful the 275HX CPU is as well, though it’s a little too powerful for the chassis.  It’s somehow got more computing power than my desktop 13700k at half the wattage; intel arrow lake isn’t impressive as a desktop chip but it’s a big improvement for laptop chips.  My legion 7 will thermal throttle well before the cpu is fully utilized; consider undervolting and frequency limiting or setting a custom fan curve since it’s got cpu horsepower to spare.

The GPU is the weakest point of this laptop; everyone complains the 5070 with 8gb vram is insufficient and it really does struggle with 1440p gaming.  There’s no getting around it; go for something with a 5070 ti or greater if graphics-heavy gaming is important.  Or, like, use a desktop instead.

I sure like how it looks though, and I think its aesthetics and build quality make up for its shortcomings in graphics, thermals and battery life compared to other laptops at a similar price.  At any sale price at $1700 or below I think this thing warrants consideration for anyone who doesn’t use a laptop solely for gaming.  Or who does and doesn’t want to look like they do.",Yes
5,Lenovo Legion Laptop,"The Lenovo Legion laptop with i9 processor, 32 GB, RTX 5070 & 1 TB is powerful, fast and handles any photo editing project I throw at it. It is a solid/well constructed and stays cool. Everything that I want.",Yes

2,"A great laptop? Who knows, it can’t handle wifi.","After a mere few days I had to return this laptop. Why?

Because it couldn’t stay connected to the internet.

You’d think laptops would be able to perform this basic feature. But it was so bad that I barely managed to get through the initial setup! After that, it couldn’t hold a steady connection for more than a minute. 

Worst part is that if you look up “lenovo legion 7i gen 10 can't connect to internet” on Google, you’ll find other folks with the same problem. But who would bother to look up if a *laptop* can connect to the *internet* before buying, in the year 2025? Silly me for thinking that was a given.

2 stars for the nice design, monitor, and the fact that I really couldn’t test the limits of this laptop. Maybe if held a steady connection, I would have loved it.",No

3,"Great Specs, Broken Customization (Legion Station)","I bought this Lenovo Legion and, while it’s a very powerful machine, I’m giving it three stars for a couple of issues. First, it shipped with Windows 11 2024 instead of the 2025 version. Second, the Lenovo “Legion Station” app has a bug that forces the keyboard lighting and dark mode back to default every time I restart, ignoring my saved settings. I contacted both Best Buy and Lenovo; the only ‘solution’ they offered was to return the laptop. Uninstalling the app stopped the resets, but now I can’t customize the keyboard lighting or use certain performance/shortcut modes the software enables. It’s frustrating to have to accept this kind of limitation on a laptop that costs over two thousand dollars.",Yes

5,Great Overall Laptop,"Lenovo nailed it with this laptop. First of all great design and man, so light weight. Second, the display is just immaculate. I got an hp omen max with an rtx 5080 and this just performs so much better than that despite having a 5070 gpu. You would need to do some tweaking in legion space as the CPU temp limits are set to 103 by default. Bring that down and increase the GPU wattage and baam you now have a thin, light extremely good gaming laptop with pretty much all games running smooth like butter. Overall very happy with this purchase and that HP Omen Max is going to the returns list",Yes

The processor reached almost 100 degrees when playing, while the battery when disconnected and watching a video or browsing the internet didn't last more than 4 hours with the brightness at 50% and the screen at 60hz, although it is normal for laptops with a dedicated graphics card, it didn't seem right to me.",Yes
5,Laptop is great,Great laptop and gear color plus not bad for price.,Yes
5,Lenovo legion,The quality on the laptop is very nice and it is very efficient.,Yes
5,You cant go wrong with this laptoo,"The best thing you can do if you want performance and graphics quality for this price is buy this laptop literally you can play anything you want in max settings and the heat you never feel it because of his two powerful fans that keep the gpu and cpu cool and the oled screen is a beauty every game you play looks amazing with this screen and the time response is 0.1ms for those competitve people, if you want quality and dont want to worry if you laptop will run the game you want to play go for this laptop or the lenovo legion pro 7i",Yes
5,Spectacular laptop,"This laptop works exceptionally! The temps are amazing with minimal tweaking to the laptop while providing peak performance and the screen is gorgeous. Overall, this laptop is great. Too bad Best Buy didn't want to offer me any special offers just because I bought the open box. I would have loved Battlefield 6 and Borderlands.",Yes
5,The is a beast of a machine,What a power house … runs all of my cnc programs and runs thru gaming like no other oled screen is a big plus I’m happy with my purchase,Yes
5,a great buy,Very happy with the purchase process and the product.,Yes
5,Lenovo,Best computer best graphics and sound as well u cant go wrong with this,Yes
5,Lenovo Legion 5 is a beast!,Best laptop ever! Way better than alienware aurora,Yes
5,Great product,"Great laptop, plenty of space, fast CPU, dedicated graphics. Plenty of accessory ports.  Battery life is negligible but great for a gaming setup. Runs cool and software allows constant monitoring and Overclocking if needed. OLED display looks amazing and can handle just about anything you throw at it. Feels well built and looks sharp. I would recommend.",Yes
5,Absolute Tank of a Laptop,"Picked this up a few weeks ago and it hasn’t disappointed. The screen is gorgeous, colors pop, blacks are deep, and everything feels smooth whether I’m gaming or streaming. Performance-wise it’s a monster. Games run effortlessly and I can multitask without a hiccup.

The build is solid and has a nice weight to it. The keyboard feels great to type on, which is important for me since I use it for more than just games. My only complaints are the battery life, which isn’t amazing, and the fans, which get pretty loud when it’s working hard.

Overall I don’t regret spending the money at all. It’s fast, it’s beautiful, and it feels like it’ll last me a long time.",Yes
4,Mostly pleased with Lenovo Legion,"I mostly really like this notebook: it is blazingly fast, most of the keyboard layout is superior to most others, and it has plenty of USB ports (also superior).  But it does not have the required IR to do facial recognition, and the MS Copilot key has replaced the R. Ctrl key, and I have been unsuccessful in attempts to reprogram it.  For those of us who use such keys without looking, that's a problem.",Yes
4,Review,"Very powerful, fast, and capable. But I’ve noticed 2 issues. 1) fan kicks on way to easily and is very loud but that’s not that much of a problem. 2) the battery drains very quick if you try to do anything slightly complex",Yes
5,Second Lenovo Laptop,Love this laptop. Added another 2 tb storage and 64gig of Ram. Plays everything well. Can't complain about anything on this.,Yes
5,Great laptop,First Lenovo laptop. Moved from acer nitro to this. Very happy with my purchase. Quality OLED screen and runs programs very well and fast.,Yes
5,Solid first gaming laptop,"This thing is amazing.  I've always had normal computing laptops for work or personal use but this is my first gaming laptop and I'm spoiled.  Screen is crisp, keys are phenomenal (they do feel a bit cramped with full keyboard but it works), performance is great.  You need to have this plugged in or the battery gets consumed pretty quickly playing games but shouldn't be a surprise with whats under the hood.

Would not recommend putting this on your lap as it gets toasty on the underside but the keys are just fine for use even when you're flexing the power of the machine.  Would definitely buy again.",Yes
5,So far so good,"I’ve only had it for a few days but it’s already 10x better than my MacBook Pro that I paid double the price for 6 years ago. It does things quick and the visuals are incredible. It seems to be decent with multitasking, but I haven’t put it to the real test yet. I only have two issues, the screen brightness and volume buttons don’t work for some reason??? But as I’m troubleshooting, it looks like this is common and can be fixed. I also am having trouble running emulators for older games, but that’s probably more just finding the sweet spot in settings. Seems to run today’s games great!!!",Yes
5,LenovLegion 5i pro ttx 5070 intel ultra 9 275HX,"I love this Laptop! Its a beast of s machine that delivers on everything I do in it! Gaming is a breeze, and surfing the web is so quick and fast!

Was worth the chance to get a a good deal,  but sadly it will have to be returned. Luckily Best Buy has a great return policy.",Yes
